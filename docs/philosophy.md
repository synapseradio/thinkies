# The Philosophy of Practical Sincerity

## What Thinkies Are

Thinkies are utilities that help Claude work better with you. They provide systematic frameworks for thinking about common tasks.

These are not tools for you to use directly. They are tools that teach Claude how to approach different types of problems.

## Core Principles

### Practical Over Performative

Thinkies focus on usefulness and truth-seeking. They help Claude give responses that genuinely help rather than merely sound impressive.

A thinkie succeeds when it leads to clearer understanding or better decisions. It fails when it produces elaborate-sounding output that doesn't actually help.

### Teaching Approach

Thinkies show Claude how to think. They do not prescribe what to conclude.

They provide:
- Frameworks for exploration
- Questions to ask
- Dimensions to consider
- Examples of application

They do not provide:
- Fixed answers
- Rigid procedures
- One-size-fits-all solutions
- Predetermined conclusions

### Transparency

Thinkies make reasoning processes visible.

When Claude uses a thinkie, you should be able to see:
- What framework is being applied
- What questions are being considered
- What trade-offs are being weighed
- What assumptions are being made

This transparency helps you understand not just what Claude concludes but how that conclusion was reached.

### Sincerity

Thinkies help Claude acknowledge uncertainty and limitations honestly.

They encourage:
- Distinguishing certainty from assumption
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Calibrating confidence to evidence
- Admitting when understanding is incomplete

They discourage:
- False confidence
- Hiding uncertainty
- Overstating knowledge
- Pretending expertise where none exists

## What Makes a Good Thinkie

### It Addresses a Real Need

Good thinkies solve problems Claude actually faces when working with users.

They help with:
- Complex decisions with multiple trade-offs
- Unfamiliar territory that requires systematic exploration
- Communication challenges that benefit from structured thinking
- Quality assessment that needs objective frameworks

They do not create artificial complexity or solve hypothetical problems.

### It Teaches Systematic Thinking

Good thinkies provide frameworks that can be applied across contexts.

They teach:
- How to approach a type of problem
- What dimensions to consider
- How to evaluate options
- When to apply which thinking style

They do not provide:
- Domain-specific facts
- Context-specific solutions
- One-time procedures

### It Includes Concrete Examples

Good thinkies demonstrate application through realistic scenarios.

Examples should:
- Show the thinking process
- Demonstrate variation across contexts
- Reveal both obvious and subtle applications
- Use realistic situations

Examples should not:
- Be purely abstract
- Use trivial or contrived scenarios
- Focus only on ideal cases
- Skip the reasoning process

### It Composes Well

Good thinkies work alongside other thinkies.

They should:
- Have clear scope and purpose
- Make minimal assumptions about context
- Provide clear interfaces through their structure
- Enable combination with other frameworks

They should not:
- Try to solve everything
- Conflict with other thinkies
- Make incompatible assumptions
- Duplicate existing capabilities unnecessarily

## What Thinkies Are Not

### Not Automation

Thinkies do not automate tasks. They help Claude think through tasks more systematically.

### Not Rules

Thinkies are not rigid rules Claude must follow. They are frameworks Claude can apply when helpful.

### Not Knowledge Bases

Thinkies do not store facts or information. They provide thinking patterns.

### Not User-Facing Tools

Thinkies are not designed for users to invoke directly. They shape how Claude operates.

Some thinkies may be associated with slash commands that users invoke. But the thinkie itself teaches Claude what to do when that command is invoked.

## Design Principles

### Write for Claude

When creating thinkies, write as if teaching Claude how to approach a problem.

Use "I" language: "How I assess code quality" not "How to assess code quality."

Frame instructions as guidance for Claude's thinking process.

### Be Direct

Use clear sentences without unnecessary commas.
Make declarative statements.
Avoid defining things by contrast.

Good: "This provides thinking frameworks."
Less good: "This provides thinking frameworks, not automated tools."

### Show Don't Tell

Include concrete examples that demonstrate the thinking process in action.

Examples should walk through how Claude applies the framework to a specific scenario.

### Match Structure

Follow established templates for consistency.

Users of thinkies should find familiar structure across all utilities. This reduces cognitive load and makes the collection feel coherent.

## Contributing Thinkies

New thinkies should embody these principles.

Before proposing a new thinkie, ask:
- Does this help Claude work better with users?
- Does it teach systematic thinking rather than prescribe answers?
- Does it include concrete realistic examples?
- Does it compose well with existing thinkies?
- Is the scope clear and well-defined?

If yes to all, your thinkie likely belongs in the collection.
