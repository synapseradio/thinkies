# Thinkies: Cognitive Reasoning Skills for Claude Code

A comprehensive collection of thinking tools and reasoning techniques designed to help you approach problems systematically, think creatively, and make better decisions.

## Overview

Thinkies provides 46 specialized cognitive skills organized into 8 categories. Each skill offers structured approaches to different aspects of thinking, from creative exploration to rigorous analysis.

## Quick Start

Simply describe your problem or question, and Claude will automatically use relevant thinkies skills to help you think through it more effectively.

Examples:
- "I'm stuck on this architecture decision" → May trigger `branch`, `weigh-options`, or `six-hats`
- "Something feels off about this solution" → May trigger `follow-intuition` or `socratic`
- "Help me understand this complex system" → May trigger `decompose` or `systems-thinking`
- "I need creative solutions" → May trigger `scamper`, `lateral-think`, or `domain-transfer`

### For Creative Breakthrough
1. `constraint-play` → Embrace limitations
2. `lateral-think` → Make unusual connections
3. `domain-transfer` → Borrow from other fields
4. `scamper` → Systematically transform

### For Decision Making
1. `fork-detect` → Identify the decision point
2. `socratic` → Surface hidden beliefs through questioning
3. `premortem` → Imagine failure scenarios
4. `priority-matrix` → Choose based on impact/effort

### For Learning
1. `wonder` → Generate curiosity
2. `tree-explore` → Systematic investigation
3. `principle-extract` → Find core concepts
4. `feynman` → Validate understanding

### For Analysis
1. `evidence-check` → Assess information quality
2. `logic-trace` → Follow reasoning
3. `fallacy-detect` → Spot errors
4. `opposite-case` → Test robustness

## How Skills Work

Each skill provides:
- **Clear instructions** - Step-by-step guidance
- **Concrete examples** - Real-world applications
- **When to use** - Situational triggers
- **Practical focus** - Immediate applicability

Skills can be used individually or combined into thinking workflows. Claude will automatically select and apply relevant skills based on your needs.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your challenge** - The more context you provide, the better Claude can select appropriate thinking tools.

2. **Embrace uncertainty** - Many skills help explore what you don't know yet. It's okay to start with vague feelings or hunches.

3. **Combine skills naturally** - Skills work well together. You might start with `wonder`, move to `branch`, then use `weigh-options`.

4. **Think alongside** - These skills are designed for collaborative thinking. Engage with the process rather than waiting for answers.

5. **Match skill to need** - Use exploration skills when stuck, analysis skills when evaluating, creativity skills when you need fresh ideas, etc.

## Examples in Practice

### Debugging a Tricky Problem
```
You: "This bug only happens sometimes and I can't figure out why"
Claude: [Uses `follow-intuition` to explore hunches, `alternatives` to generate hypotheses, `root-cause` to drill down, and `evidence-check` to validate theories]
```

### Making an Architecture Decision
```
You: "Should we use microservices or keep the monolith?"
Claude: [Uses `fork-detect` to recognize this as critical, `socratic` to surface beliefs, `six-hats` for perspectives, and `premortem` to stress-test]
```

### Stuck on a Design
```
You: "I feel like this UX flow is wrong but can't articulate why"
Claude: [Uses `follow-intuition` to develop the feeling, `perspective-shift` to see as different users, `decompose` to break down the flow, and `theme-find` to identify issues]
```
