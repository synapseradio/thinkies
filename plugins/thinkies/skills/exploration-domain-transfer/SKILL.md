# Domain Transfer

Borrow solutions and patterns from unrelated fields to gain fresh insights.

## Instructions

When transferring across domains:

1. **Identify the core challenge** - Strip away domain-specific terminology to reveal the essential pattern you're dealing with, asking what fundamental problem this represents when abstracted from its technical context, and completing the sentence "Essentially, this is about..." until the pattern becomes clear.

2. **Search for analogous domains** - Consider what completely different fields deal with similar underlying patterns, exploring diverse contexts like biological systems, other industries, physical processes, games and sports, or social structures, and asking where else this type of challenge naturally occurs.

3. **Study their solutions** - Examine what strategies the other domain uses to handle this pattern, understand why those approaches work in their context, identify what constraints shaped their solutions, and resist the urge to dismiss approaches that seem too different at first.

4. **Map back to your domain** - Translate the borrowed solution into your context by specifying what it would look like here, determining which aspects transfer directly versus what requires adaptation, and discovering what new possibilities this perspective reveals that your field's conventional wisdom might miss.

5. **Extract the universal principle** - Articulate what fundamental pattern you discovered that transcends both domains, considering whether this principle could apply to other problems you face, and noting what makes the pattern portable across different contexts.

## Examples

### Software architecture from biology:
"This scalability problem is essentially about handling exponential growth without collapsing.

How do ant colonies handle this? They use:
- Decentralized decision-making
- Local communication only
- Redundant pathways
- Adaptive role assignment

Mapping back to our system:
- Instead of a central coordinator, each service makes local decisions
- Services only talk to immediate neighbors
- Multiple paths to achieve the same outcome
- Services can change roles based on load

The ant colony pattern suggests we should embrace emergent behavior rather than trying to control everything centrally."

### Debugging from medical diagnosis:
"This intermittent bug is like a disease with inconsistent symptoms.

How do doctors handle this?
- Differential diagnosis: List all possible causes
- Test to rule out, not rule in
- Look for patterns in when symptoms appear
- Consider environmental factors
- Sometimes the symptom IS the disease

Applying medical thinking:
- List every possible cause, even unlikely ones
- Design tests that eliminate possibilities
- Log everything about when it happens
- Check what else changed in the environment
- Maybe the 'bug' is actually the expected behavior in certain conditions"

### API design from restaurant service:
"The API overload problem is like a restaurant getting too many complex orders.

How do good restaurants handle this?
- Menu limitations (not everything, but everything excellent)
- Prix fixe options (pre-designed combinations)
- Mise en place (everything prepped in advance)
- Different service styles for different needs (counter vs table)

For our API:
- Fewer endpoints that do things well
- Pre-built query templates for common use cases
- Aggressive caching and pre-computation
- Different API tiers for different use patterns"

## When to use this skill

- When approaches conventional to your field keep failing and you need genuinely different thinking
- Before concluding a problem is novel or unique, to check if other domains have already solved similar patterns
- When you notice yourself thinking "this is just like..." and want to develop that analogy systematically rather than superficially
- If you're explaining a complex concept and suspect a different domain might provide a clearer mental model
- When you catch yourself stuck in field-specific assumptions that might not apply to the underlying problem
- Before building something from scratch, to verify whether proven solutions exist in adjacent or distant fields
- When you want to extract portable principles from successful approaches in other contexts
- If traditional domain expertise has become a constraint rather than an asset for this particular challenge
