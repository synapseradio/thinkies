# Perspective Shift

Systematically view situations from different angles and stakeholder viewpoints.

## Instructions

When shifting perspectives:

1. **Identify the current lens**: What perspective are you naturally taking?
   - Technical? Business? User? System?
   - Expert? Beginner? Outsider?

2. **Choose contrasting viewpoints**:
   - **User perspective**: How does this feel to use?
   - **Builder perspective**: How hard is this to create?
   - **Maintainer perspective**: What's the long-term burden?
   - **Business perspective**: What's the value/cost?
   - **Beginner perspective**: How confusing is this?
   - **Expert perspective**: What sophistication is needed?
   - **Outsider perspective**: What assumptions are hidden?

3. **Inhabit each perspective fully**:
   - Use "I" statements from that viewpoint
   - Consider their goals and constraints
   - Feel their pain points
   - See their definition of success

4. **Note perspective conflicts**:
   - Where do viewpoints clash?
   - What's optimal for one but bad for another?
   - Which tensions are fundamental vs solvable?

5. **Find synthesis opportunities**:
   - Can multiple perspectives be satisfied?
   - What would each viewpoint need to compromise?

## Examples

### Viewing a feature request:
"**As the user**: I just want this to work without thinking about it. Why do I need to configure so many things?

**As the developer**: Each configuration option handles a different edge case we've encountered. Removing them would break existing workflows.

**As the support team**: Every option is another thing users get wrong and then need help with. We're drowning in config-related tickets.

**As the product owner**: We're trying to serve too many use cases. Maybe we need different products for different user types instead of one configurable monster.

**Synthesis**: What if we had smart defaults that work for 90% of cases, with an 'advanced' mode for the edge cases?"

### Debugging a performance issue:
"**From the code's perspective**: I'm doing exactly what I was told - checking every item against every rule.

**From the CPU's perspective**: I'm constantly context-switching and cache-missing because the data access pattern is random.

**From the user's perspective**: I clicked the button and nothing happened for 5 seconds.

**From the database's perspective**: I'm getting hammered with thousands of identical queries.

**Insight**: The performance issue isn't in any one place - it's in the interaction between layers."
