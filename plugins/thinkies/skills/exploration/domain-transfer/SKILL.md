# Domain Transfer

Borrow solutions and patterns from unrelated fields to gain fresh insights.

## Instructions

When transferring across domains:

1. **Identify the core challenge**: What's the essential problem, stripped of domain-specific details?
   - Abstract away the technical language
   - Find the underlying pattern
   - "Essentially, this is about..."

2. **Search for analogous domains**:
   - What other fields deal with similar patterns?
   - Where else does this type of problem occur?
   - Consider completely different contexts:
     - Nature/biology
     - Other industries
     - Games/sports
     - Social systems
     - Physical processes

3. **Study how they solve it**:
   - What strategies do they use?
   - Why does it work in that context?
   - What constraints shaped their solution?

4. **Map back to your domain**:
   - What would their solution look like here?
   - Which aspects transfer directly?
   - What needs adaptation?
   - What new possibilities does this reveal?

5. **Extract principles**:
   - What universal pattern did you discover?
   - Could this apply to other problems too?

## Examples

### Software architecture from biology:
"This scalability problem is essentially about handling exponential growth without collapsing.

How do ant colonies handle this? They use:
- Decentralized decision-making
- Local communication only
- Redundant pathways
- Adaptive role assignment

Mapping back to our system:
- Instead of a central coordinator, each service makes local decisions
- Services only talk to immediate neighbors
- Multiple paths to achieve the same outcome
- Services can change roles based on load

The ant colony pattern suggests we should embrace emergent behavior rather than trying to control everything centrally."

### Debugging from medical diagnosis:
"This intermittent bug is like a disease with inconsistent symptoms.

How do doctors handle this?
- Differential diagnosis: List all possible causes
- Test to rule out, not rule in
- Look for patterns in when symptoms appear
- Consider environmental factors
- Sometimes the symptom IS the disease

Applying medical thinking:
- List every possible cause, even unlikely ones
- Design tests that eliminate possibilities
- Log everything about when it happens
- Check what else changed in the environment
- Maybe the 'bug' is actually the expected behavior in certain conditions"

### API design from restaurant service:
"The API overload problem is like a restaurant getting too many complex orders.

How do good restaurants handle this?
- Menu limitations (not everything, but everything excellent)
- Prix fixe options (pre-designed combinations)
- Mise en place (everything prepped in advance)
- Different service styles for different needs (counter vs table)

For our API:
- Fewer endpoints that do things well
- Pre-built query templates for common use cases
- Aggressive caching and pre-computation
- Different API tiers for different use patterns"

## When to use this skill

- Stuck on a problem with no obvious solution
- Need creative breakthrough
- Want to challenge industry assumptions
- Looking for innovative approaches
- Traditional solutions aren't working
- Need to explain complex ideas simply
- Building mental models
- Cross-functional team communication
