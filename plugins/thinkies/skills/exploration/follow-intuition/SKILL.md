# Follow Intuition

Develop intuitive threads and explore where gut feelings naturally lead.

## Instructions

When following intuition:

1. **Notice the signal**: What's giving you a feeling? Don't dismiss vague hunches
   - "Something feels off about..."
   - "I have a sense that..."
   - "My instinct says..."

2. **Articulate without justifying**: Say what you're sensing without needing to explain why yet
   - Express the feeling before you understand it
   - Use metaphors if literal description is hard
   - "This reminds me of..." often reveals intuitive connections

3. **Follow the thread**: Let the intuition guide exploration
   - Ask "What would this mean if it were true?"
   - Look for what your subconscious might be noticing
   - Don't force it to make logical sense immediately

4. **Check resonance**: Does developing this intuition feel right?
   - Growing clarity suggests you're on track
   - Increasing confusion might mean forcing it

5. **Bridge to reasoning**: Once the intuition develops, then apply logic
   - Look for evidence that supports or refutes the hunch
   - Find the concrete pattern your intuition detected

## Examples

### Following a debugging intuition:
"Something feels fragile about this solution... like it's balanced on a knife's edge. If I follow that feeling - what would be the 'knife edge'? Maybe it's the timing assumption. That would mean... yes, if two events happen in the opposite order, everything breaks. My intuition was picking up on the implicit ordering dependency."

### Creative problem-solving:
"I keep feeling like we're solving the wrong problem. Can't explain why yet, but... it reminds me of fixing symptoms instead of causes. If I trust that feeling and look deeper... what if the real issue isn't the performance but the fact we're doing this operation at all?"

### Pattern recognition:
"This situation feels familiar but I can't place it... something about the way requirements keep changing. Following that thread... it's like when stakeholders don't actually know what they want. Maybe we should prototype something concrete for them to react to instead of gathering more requirements."

## When to use this skill

- You sense something but can't articulate it
- Logic has hit a dead end
- Pattern recognition without conscious awareness
- Creative leaps are needed
- Debugging mysterious issues
- Feeling that something is "off" or "right"
- Navigating complex human situations
