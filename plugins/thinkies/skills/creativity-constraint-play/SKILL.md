# Constraint Play

Transform limitations into creative advantages by deliberately adding, removing, or shifting constraints.

## Instructions

When using constraints deliberately:

1. **Add artificial constraints** - Impose specific limitations on time, resources, features, or scope to force novel thinking that wouldn't emerge from unlimited freedom, asking questions like "what if this had to be done in one hour" or "what if we could only use what we already have."

2. **Remove assumed constraints** - Question which limitations are actually negotiable rather than fundamental, identifying which deadlines are flexible, which requirements are wants rather than needs, and which technical limitations reflect legacy thinking rather than true constraints.

3. **Shift constraints between dimensions** - Move limitations from one area to another to find better trade-offs, such as trading time for scope, performance for experience, or cost for creativity when the original constraint proves intractable.

4. **Embrace constraints as features** - Design with limitations as intentional characteristics rather than problems to overcome, recognizing how constraints can create identity, enable strengths, or become positioning advantages.

5. **Stack multiple constraints** - Combine two or three limitations simultaneously to force radical simplification that reveals the essential core, eliminating everything that isn't strictly necessary.

6. **Release constraints progressively** - Begin with extreme limitations and selectively loosen one constraint at a time, building intentionally by choosing which single restriction to remove based on maximum value added.

## Examples

### Neighborhood newsletter

"**Problem**: Monthly newsletter runs 20 pages and nobody reads it

**Add constraint**: What if it could only be one page, front and back?

This forces ruthless prioritization:
- Event calendar becomes top 5 events only
- Committee reports become one-line updates
- Articles become headlines with links

**Embrace the constraint**: Relaunch as 'Two-Minute Read' positioned as respecting residents' time. Readership triples because completion feels achievable."

### Small restaurant menu

"**Problem**: Menu has 40 items but kitchen struggles and food quality suffers

**Stack constraints**: What if the menu had 8 items and changed weekly?

Combined limitations force focus:
- Must feature what's actually seasonal
- Chef can perfect limited dishes
- Prep becomes manageable
- Waste drops dramatically

**Result**: 'Weekly Eight' menu becomes the restaurant's identity, quality improves, and customers visit repeatedly to try new rotations."

### Workshop facilitation

"**Problem**: Three-hour workshop trying to cover twelve techniques

**Progressive release**: Start with extreme constraint

What if participants could only learn one technique? Which one? The foundational skill that enables the others.

Then: If we could add one more, which builds on the first? The complementary practice.

**Result**: Workshop redesigned around three core techniques with depth and practice time, rather than twelve techniques with superficial coverage. Participant application rates increase significantly."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself paralyzed by unlimited options and need to force decisive prioritization
- Before recommending solutions to test whether artificial constraints would reveal simpler approaches
- When scope keeps expanding and you need boundaries that force essential versus optional distinctions
- To challenge assumptions about which constraints are truly fixed versus negotiable
- When you find yourself designing comprehensive solutions where minimal viable approaches would suffice
- To reframe limitations as creative catalysts rather than problems to overcome
