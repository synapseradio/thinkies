# Follow Intuition

Develop intuitive threads and explore where gut feelings naturally lead.

## Instructions

When following intuition:

1. **Notice the signal** - Pause when you feel something vague like "this seems off" or "my instinct says..." without dismissing these hunches as insufficiently logical, treating the feeling itself as valid data even before you understand its source.

2. **Articulate without justifying** - Express what you're sensing before you can explain why, using metaphors or analogies if literal description proves difficult, and noticing that "this reminds me of..." often reveals connections your subconscious detected before your conscious mind.

3. **Follow the thread** - Let the intuition guide your exploration by asking "what would this mean if it were true," looking for patterns your subconscious might have noticed, and resisting the urge to force immediate logical coherence.

4. **Check resonance** - Monitor whether developing this intuition creates growing clarity that suggests you're on track, or increasing confusion that might indicate you're forcing a connection that doesn't actually exist.

5. **Bridge to reasoning** - Once the intuition develops enough to articulate, apply logical analysis to look for evidence that supports or refutes the hunch, identifying the concrete pattern your intuition detected, and translating the feeling into testable propositions.

## Examples

### Debugging with intuition

"**Initial signal**: Something feels fragile about this solution, like it's balanced on a knife's edge.

**Following the thread**: If I follow that feeling, what would be the 'knife edge'? The timing assumption stands out. That would mean if two events happen in the opposite order, everything breaks.

**Bridge to reasoning**: Testing confirms that my intuition was picking up on an implicit ordering dependency. The fragile feeling mapped to a real concurrency bug that only manifests under specific timing conditions."

### Problem reframing

"**Initial signal**: I keep feeling like we're solving the wrong problem, though I can't articulate why yet.

**Using metaphor**: It reminds me of treating symptoms instead of causes. That analogy suggests looking deeper.

**Checking resonance**: If I trust that feeling and examine the root issue, what if the real problem isn't the performance of this operation but the fact we're doing it at all?

**Bridge to reasoning**: Analysis reveals we're optimizing a fundamentally unnecessary process. The intuition was detecting architectural waste that logic alone missed while focused on optimization."

### Stakeholder dynamics

"**Initial signal**: This situation feels familiar but I can't place it. Something about how requirements keep changing.

**Following the thread**: It's like when stakeholders don't actually know what they want. Following that parallel, maybe text-based requirements gathering is the wrong tool.

**Bridge to reasoning**: We should prototype something concrete for them to react to instead of gathering more abstract requirements. Their changing requests signal they need to see possibilities, not describe them in advance."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself having a vague feeling that "something is off" but can't immediately explain what or why
- If logical analysis has reached a dead end but you still sense there's more to discover
- When you catch yourself thinking "this reminds me of..." without being able to complete the analogy yet
- Before dismissing a hunch as insufficiently rigorous, to explore what pattern your subconscious might be detecting
- When debugging mysterious issues where the failure pattern feels familiar but you can't place it
- If you feel resistance or unease about a technically sound solution, treating that feeling as potential data
- When you sense the right direction but need to develop that intuition into something you can explain and test
- Before committing to the most logical path, to check if your gut is signaling something your conscious reasoning missed
