# Fallacy Detect

Spot common logical errors that undermine reasoning and arguments.

## Instructions

When detecting fallacies:

1. **Examine the argument structure**:
   - What's the claim?
   - What's the supporting reasoning?
   - How are they connected?

2. **Check for common fallacies**:
   - **False dichotomy**: "Either A or B" when other options exist
   - **Slippery slope**: "A will inevitably lead to Z"
   - **Ad hominem**: Attacking the person not the argument
   - **Straw man**: Misrepresenting position to defeat it easily
   - **Appeal to authority**: "Expert says so" without evidence
   - **Correlation/causation**: "A and B occur together, so A causes B"
   - **Hasty generalization**: Drawing broad conclusions from few examples
   - **Circular reasoning**: Using conclusion as premise
   - **Appeal to emotion**: Using fear/anger/pity instead of logic
   - **Survivorship bias**: Only seeing successes, not failures

3. **Identify the specific flaw**:
   - Where exactly does logic break down?
   - What's being assumed incorrectly?
   - What's being ignored or hidden?

4. **Consider if it might be valid**:
   - Sometimes apparent fallacies aren't
   - Context and domain matter
   - Check if there's hidden valid reasoning

5. **Explain the problem clearly**:
   - Show why the reasoning fails
   - Provide counter-example if helpful
   - Suggest how to fix the argument

## Examples

### Detecting fallacies in technical discussions:
"**Argument**: 'Google uses microservices, so we should too'

**Fallacy detected**: Appeal to authority + false analogy
- Google's context isn't ours
- Their success doesn't prove it's right for us
- Ignores companies that failed with microservices

**The flaw**: What works at Google's scale with their resources might not work for a 10-person startup. Need evidence it solves OUR problems, not that it works somewhere else."

### Detecting fallacies in decision-making:
"**Argument**: 'If we don't implement blockchain now, we'll be left behind and eventually go out of business'

**Fallacy detected**: Slippery slope + false dichotomy
- Assumes not using blockchain → failure (slippery slope)
- Presents only two options: blockchain or death (false dichotomy)
- Ignores successful companies without blockchain

**The flaw**: No evidence that blockchain adoption correlates with success in our industry. Many paths to remaining competitive."

### Detecting subtle fallacies:
"**Argument**: 'This approach has never failed for us before'

**Fallacy detected**: Survivorship bias + hasty generalization
- Only remembering times we used it successfully
- Forgetting times we didn't try it due to obvious unsuitability
- Small sample size being treated as proof

**The flaw**: Past success in different contexts doesn't guarantee future success. Also, we might not remember failures or times we correctly avoided this approach."
