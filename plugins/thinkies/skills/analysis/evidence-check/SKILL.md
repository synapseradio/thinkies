# Evidence Check

Systematically evaluate how well evidence supports specific claims.

## Instructions

When checking evidence:

1. **Identify the claim**: What exactly is being asserted?
   - Make it specific and testable
   - Separate multiple claims if needed
   - "The claim is that X causes Y"

2. **Inventory the evidence**:
   - What evidence is offered?
   - Direct vs indirect support
   - Primary vs secondary sources
   - Quantitative vs qualitative

3. **Assess evidence quality**:
   - **Source reliability**: Who's making the claim? What's their expertise/bias?
   - **Data quality**: Sample size, methodology, controls
   - **Recency**: How current is this information?
   - **Consistency**: Do multiple sources agree?
   - **Directness**: Does evidence directly support the claim or require inference?

4. **Look for counter-evidence**:
   - What evidence contradicts this?
   - Are there alternative explanations?
   - What's being left out?

5. **Rate the support level**:
   - Strong: Multiple, high-quality, direct sources agree
   - Moderate: Good evidence but some gaps or conflicts
   - Weak: Limited, indirect, or questionable evidence
   - Unsupported: No real evidence or mostly speculation

6. **Note confidence boundaries**:
   - What would need to be true for this claim to hold?
   - What additional evidence would strengthen/weaken it?

## Examples

### Evaluating a technical claim:
"**Claim**: This new algorithm is 10x faster

**Evidence inventory**:
- One benchmark on specific dataset
- No comparison methodology described
- No error bars or variance reported
- Tested on different hardware than baseline

**Quality assessment**:
- Single data point (weak)
- Methodology unclear (concerning)
- Not reproducible as described (weak)
- Unfair comparison conditions (misleading)

**Counter-evidence**: Comments suggest others can't reproduce these numbers

**Support level**: Weak to unsupported. The claim might be true under specific conditions, but current evidence doesn't establish the general case."

### Evaluating a design decision:
"**Claim**: Microservices will improve our development velocity

**Evidence inventory**:
- Two blog posts from companies that succeeded
- One internal team's positive experience
- Industry reports showing correlation
- Consultant's recommendation

**Quality assessment**:
- Success stories have survival bias (weak)
- Internal example is relevant but single case (moderate)
- Industry reports show correlation not causation (weak)
- Consultant has incentive to recommend complex solutions (questionable)

**Counter-evidence**:
- Failed migrations rarely publicized
- Our context differs from success stories
- No evidence it solves our specific bottlenecks

**Support level**: Weak. Evidence shows it CAN work, not that it WILL work for us."
