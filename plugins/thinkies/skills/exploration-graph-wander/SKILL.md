# Graph Wander

Explore topics through free-form connections, allowing unexpected relationships to emerge.

## Instructions

When wandering as a graph:

1. **Start anywhere interesting** - Choose what naturally draws your attention without worrying about finding the "right" starting point, allowing multiple entry points if several concepts feel relevant.

2. **Follow connections naturally** - Let each idea remind you of others by noticing when you think "this makes me think of..." or "this relates to...," jumping between even distant concepts if a genuine connection exists, and trusting associative thinking to reveal relationships.

3. **Build bridges** - Explain each connection as you make it, recognizing that these bridges between ideas often contain the real insights, and valuing even seemingly weak connections since they might reveal unexpected relationships.

4. **Revisit nodes** - Return to earlier ideas with new perspective gained from the wandering, understanding that each return adds new connections rather than being repetitive, and seeing cycles as productive deepening rather than circular thinking.

5. **Let patterns emerge** - Avoid forcing structure prematurely, noticing which concepts keep reappearing across different paths, observing what clusters form naturally, and identifying hub concepts that connect to many other ideas.

6. **Map the territory** - Periodically zoom out to see the whole graph of connections you've built, noting which linkages surprise you, and articulating what the overall structure reveals about the problem space.

## Examples

### Wandering through a technical problem:
"Starting with the memory leak... this reminds me of our caching strategy, which connects to the session timeout issue. Interesting - the timeout problem also relates to the user complaints about lost work.

That makes me think about our auto-save feature... which, wait, uses the same memory pool that's leaking. I'm seeing a pattern: all our state preservation mechanisms are interconnected.

Going back to the memory leak with this perspective - it's not just a technical issue, it's threatening our entire state management approach. The user experience issues and the technical problems are actually the same problem manifesting differently..."

### Creative problem solving:
"This API design challenge... reminds me of how restaurants handle orders. They have a ticket system - order placement is separated from fulfillment.

That connects to our async processing needs. But restaurants also have expeditors who coordinate... that's like our orchestration layer, but we're missing the coordination aspect.

This links back to why our API feels clunky - we're trying to be both the waiter and the kitchen. What if we separated concerns like a restaurant does?

Oh, and restaurants handle modifications to in-progress orders... that's exactly our update challenge..."

## When to use this skill

- When linear, sequential thinking feels constraining and you sense that relationships exist beyond the obvious next step
- If you're trying to understand a complex system where everything connects to everything else
- When you notice yourself wanting to explore multiple threads simultaneously rather than following one to completion
- Before forcing a hierarchical structure, to discover what natural clusters and connections exist
- If synthesizing diverse information from multiple sources that don't obviously fit a single narrative
- When building a mental model of an unfamiliar domain and need to let the territory reveal its own structure
- To find hidden connections between concepts that seem unrelated on the surface
- When you catch yourself thinking "this reminds me of something else" repeatedly, signaling rich associative potential
