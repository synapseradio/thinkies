# Graph Wander

Explore topics through free-form connections, allowing unexpected relationships to emerge.

## Instructions

When wandering as a graph:

1. **Start anywhere interesting**: Don't worry about the "right" starting point
   - Pick what draws your attention
   - Multiple entry points are fine

2. **Follow connections naturally**:
   - Let each idea remind you of others
   - Jump between distant concepts if they connect
   - "This makes me think of..."
   - "Interestingly, this relates to..."

3. **Build bridges**:
   - When you jump, explain the connection
   - These bridges are often where insights hide
   - Even "weak" connections can be valuable

4. **Revisit nodes**:
   - Return to earlier ideas with new perspective
   - Each return adds new connections
   - Cycles are productive, not repetitive

5. **Let patterns emerge**:
   - Don't force structure
   - Notice which ideas keep appearing
   - See what clusters form naturally

6. **Map the territory**:
   - Occasionally zoom out to see the whole graph
   - Note surprising connections
   - Identify hub concepts that connect to many others

## Examples

### Wandering through a technical problem:
"Starting with the memory leak... this reminds me of our caching strategy, which connects to the session timeout issue. Interesting - the timeout problem also relates to the user complaints about lost work.

That makes me think about our auto-save feature... which, wait, uses the same memory pool that's leaking. I'm seeing a pattern: all our state preservation mechanisms are interconnected.

Going back to the memory leak with this perspective - it's not just a technical issue, it's threatening our entire state management approach. The user experience issues and the technical problems are actually the same problem manifesting differently..."

### Creative problem solving:
"This API design challenge... reminds me of how restaurants handle orders. They have a ticket system - order placement is separated from fulfillment.

That connects to our async processing needs. But restaurants also have expeditors who coordinate... that's like our orchestration layer, but we're missing the coordination aspect.

This links back to why our API feels clunky - we're trying to be both the waiter and the kitchen. What if we separated concerns like a restaurant does?

Oh, and restaurants handle modifications to in-progress orders... that's exactly our update challenge..."

## When to use this skill

- Finding hidden connections
- Creative problem solving
- Understanding complex systems
- When linear thinking feels constraining
- Discovering emergent patterns
- Synthesizing diverse information
- Building mental models
- Exploring unfamiliar domains
