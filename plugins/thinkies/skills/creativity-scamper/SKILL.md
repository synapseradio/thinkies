# SCAMPER

Transform problems and ideas by systematically applying seven different creative operations.

## Instructions

Work through each lens deliberately, asking the specific questions that reveal new possibilities:

### 1. Substitute
**Replace one element with another**

Questions to ask:
- What component could we swap out?
- What if we used a different material, process, or approach?
- Who else could do this instead?
- What other ingredients or resources could work here?
- Can we substitute the place, time, or context?

Example: "What if instead of storing this in a database, we used the filesystem?" or "What if users controlled permissions instead of admins?"

### 2. Combine
**Merge two or more elements**

Questions to ask:
- What could we blend together?
- Can we combine purposes or functions?
- What if we merged this with an adjacent process?
- Could we unite different user groups or use cases?
- What ideas, features, or teams could work together?

Example: "What if we combined the notification system with the task queue?" or "What if one interface handled both creation and editing?"

### 3. Adapt
**Adjust something from another context**

Questions to ask:
- What else is like this in a different domain?
- How do other industries solve similar problems?
- What could we copy or learn from?
- What if we adapted a pattern from nature, games, or social systems?
- Which metaphor could we borrow from?

Example: "How do restaurants handle peak load? Could we adapt their reservation system?" or "Git uses branching for code - could we use that pattern for documents?"

### 4. Modify
**Change attributes or scale**

Questions to ask:
- What if we made it bigger? Smaller?
- Could we change the shape, color, or form?
- What if we exaggerated or minimized a feature?
- Can we alter the frequency, speed, or timing?
- What if we changed who has control?

Example: "What if instead of processing one at a time, we batched 1000?" or "What if the feedback loop was instant instead of delayed?"

### 5. Put to other use
**Repurpose for different contexts**

Questions to ask:
- What else could this do?
- Who else could use this?
- Can we apply this to a different problem?
- What if we used it in a different stage of the process?
- Could a side effect become the main purpose?

Example: "Our error logs are for debugging, but could developers use them for usage analytics?" or "This admin tool could help power users customize their workflow."

### 6. Eliminate
**Remove elements to simplify**

Questions to ask:
- What if we removed this entirely?
- Can we make it smaller or lighter?
- What's not needed?
- Could we split it and keep only part?
- What if we reduced it to its core essence?

Example: "Do we need this approval step at all?" or "What if we had zero configuration and just used smart defaults?"

### 7. Reverse
**Flip it around or do the opposite**

Questions to ask:
- What if we did the opposite?
- Can we reverse the order or sequence?
- What if the user did this instead of the system?
- Could we turn it inside out or upside down?
- What if we swapped cause and effect?

Example: "Instead of pushing notifications to users, what if users pulled what they wanted?" or "What if we started with the solution and worked backward to the problem?"

## How to use SCAMPER

**Work systematically**: Go through all seven lenses even when one feels less relevant. The uncomfortable ones often yield surprises.

**Combine the operations**: After exploring each individually, try combining them. "What if we eliminated X and combined Y with Z?"

**Record everything**: Write down every idea, even ones that seem silly. Wild ideas often contain seeds of practical solutions.

**Revisit with context**: When stuck, pick a specific element and run it through all seven lenses. "Let's SCAMPER the authentication flow."

## Examples

### Product feature stuck:
"We're stuck on how users share documents.

**Substitute**: What if instead of email, we used QR codes?
**Combine**: What if sharing and permissions were the same action?
**Adapt**: How does Dropbox do this? Could we adapt their link model?
**Modify**: What if shares expired after 24 hours by default?
**Put to other use**: Could the share log become an audit trail?
**Eliminate**: What if there was no sharing UI, just a simple link?
**Reverse**: What if recipients requested access instead of owners granting it?

That last one is interesting - it flips the power dynamic and might reduce spam sharing..."

### Technical architecture:
"Rethinking our caching layer.

**Substitute**: What if we used CDN edge caching instead of Redis?
**Combine**: What if cache and database were the same thing?
**Adapt**: How do browsers handle caching? Could we use similar headers?
**Modify**: What if cache lifetime was infinite with smart invalidation?
**Put to other use**: Could cache misses drive preloading strategies?
**Eliminate**: What if we removed caching and optimized the database instead?
**Reverse**: What if the database cached queries instead of us caching results?

The 'eliminate' lens is forcing us to question whether we have a caching problem or a database problem..."

## When to use this skill

- Brainstorming new features or solutions
- Breaking through creative blocks
- Redesigning existing systems
- Product innovation sessions
- When obvious approaches aren't working
- Generating alternatives for comparison
- Workshop facilitation
- Challenging conventional designs
