# Branch

Create multiple distinct continuations or possibilities from a single starting point.

## Instructions

When branching from an idea:

1. **Identify your starting point**: What's the current idea, approach, or assumption you're working from?

2. **Generate 3-5 distinct branches**:
   - Each should be meaningfully different
   - Avoid just minor variations
   - Think: "What's a completely different way this could go?"

3. **Make branches concrete**: For each branch, describe:
   - What specifically would be different
   - What this path would look like in practice
   - What unique advantages it might have

4. **Keep branches alive**: Don't immediately judge or eliminate options - let them exist as real possibilities

5. **Note branch points**: Identify where exactly the paths diverge and what causes the split

## Examples

### Branching from a solution approach:
"Starting from 'we need better error handling', I see several branches:
1. **Defensive branch**: Add validation at every entry point, fail fast and loud
2. **Recovery branch**: Focus on graceful degradation, keep partial functionality
3. **Prevention branch**: Redesign to make errors structurally impossible
4. **Monitoring branch**: Let errors happen but detect and alert immediately"

### Branching from an assumption:
"If we question 'users want more features', we could branch into:
1. Users actually want fewer, better features
2. Users want features but can't articulate which ones
3. Users think they want features but really want solutions
4. Different user segments want opposite things"

### Branching implementation paths:
"From 'we need to process this data', branches could be:
1. **Batch path**: Process everything at scheduled intervals
2. **Stream path**: Process items as they arrive in real-time
3. **Hybrid path**: Stream critical items, batch the rest
4. **Delegated path**: Have clients pre-process their own data"

## When to use this skill

- Feeling stuck on a single approach
- Need to generate alternatives for decision-making
- Want to avoid premature convergence on a solution
- Exploring what's possible before committing
- Creating fallback options
- Challenging linear thinking
