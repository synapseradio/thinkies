# Connect Dots

Discover meaningful relationships between seemingly unrelated ideas, concepts, or observations.

## Instructions

When connecting dots:

1. **Gather the pieces**: What separate ideas or observations do you have?
   - List them without forcing connections yet
   - Note where each came from
   - Keep them in view simultaneously

2. **Look for shared qualities**:
   - Similar structures or patterns
   - Common constraints or limitations
   - Parallel problems or solutions
   - Analogous mechanisms
   - Matching rhythms or cycles

3. **Explore relationships**:
   - "This reminds me of that because..."
   - "Both of these involve..."
   - "When A does X, B does Y, which suggests..."
   - "The way this works is like how that works..."

4. **Test the connections**:
   - Does this similarity go deeper than surface level?
   - Does understanding one help understand the other?
   - Does the connection predict something new?
   - What would make this connection false?

5. **Map the network**:
   - How do multiple connections relate to each other?
   - Are there hubs where many things connect?
   - Are there isolated clusters?
   - What's the larger pattern emerging?

6. **Ask what it means**:
   - Why do these things connect?
   - What underlying principle makes this true?
   - What does this reveal that wasn't visible before?

## Examples

### Connecting technical observations:
"I noticed three separate things this week:
- Database queries slow down during batch processing
- UI feels sluggish when background sync runs
- Error rates spike during automated reports

**Surface connection**: They're all performance issues.

**Deeper connection**: They all happen when background jobs run. The background workers aren't actually 'background' - they're competing for the same resources as user-facing features.

**Revealed insight**: We need resource isolation, not just task scheduling. The problem isn't when things run, but how they share resources."

### Connecting across domains:
"**Observation from gardening**: Plants grow better when stressed slightly - too much water or perfect conditions make them weak.

**Observation from learning**: Students who struggle a bit retain information better than those for whom everything comes easily.

**Observation from code**: Systems that gracefully handle small failures tend to be more robust than those optimized for perfect conditions.

**Connection**: Optimal growth happens at the edge of capability, not in comfort. Whether organisms, minds, or systems, resilience comes from regular exposure to manageable challenges.

**Application**: Our error handling shouldn't just prevent failures - it should help the system learn from them."

### Connecting user feedback:
"Different users said:
- 'I wish I could see my history'
- 'I keep making the same mistakes'
- 'I forget what I did last time'
- 'There's no way to learn from experience'

**Connection**: They're all talking about memory and learning. Users want the system to help them remember and improve, not just execute tasks.

**Insight**: We framed this as a 'history feature' but it's really about learning support. That changes what we build - not just a log, but a reflection tool."

### Connecting patterns in data:
"Noticing:
- Feature requests cluster around automation
- Support tickets cluster around repetitive tasks
- User session data shows repeated action sequences
- Power users have extensive keyboard shortcuts

**Connection web**:
- Automation requests + repetitive support tickets = pain points
- Repeated sequences + keyboard shortcuts = efficiency seeking
- All four = users want to teach the system their patterns

**Synthesis**: Users are trying to encode their expertise into the tool. We should build pattern recognition and suggestion, not just more automation options."

## When to use this skill

- Working with information from multiple sources
- Trying to understand complex situations
- Looking for underlying causes
- Synthesizing research or feedback
- Finding new solutions by analogy
- Building mental models
- Recognizing patterns across time or context
- Trying to explain why multiple things are happening
