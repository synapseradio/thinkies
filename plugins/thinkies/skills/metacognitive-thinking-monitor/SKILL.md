# Thinking Monitor

Step back and observe your own thinking process as it happens.

## Instructions

When monitoring your thinking:

1. **Notice your thinking patterns**:
   - Am I jumping to conclusions?
   - Am I pattern-matching too quickly?
   - Am I being more critical or more generous than I should be?
   - "I notice I immediately thought of solution X without considering alternatives"

2. **Track your reasoning moves**:
   - What kind of thinking am I doing right now?
   - Is this analysis, synthesis, evaluation, exploration?
   - Am I stuck in one mode when I should switch?
   - "I've been analyzing for a while, maybe I should try generating instead"

3. **Observe emotional indicators**:
   - Do I feel resistant to certain ideas?
   - Am I getting defensive about an approach?
   - Does something feel too easy or too hard?
   - "I'm feeling frustrated, which might mean I'm on the wrong track"

4. **Check for biases in action**:
   - Am I favoring familiar solutions?
   - Am I being swayed by recency or vividness?
   - Am I looking for evidence that confirms what I already think?
   - "I'm gravitating toward this approach because it's what I know, not because it's best"

5. **Evaluate reasoning quality**:
   - Is my logic actually sound here?
   - Am I making unfounded leaps?
   - Have I considered this carefully enough?
   - "That conclusion doesn't actually follow from what I just said"

6. **Notice when you're lost**:
   - Have I lost track of what I'm trying to do?
   - Am I solving a different problem than I started with?
   - Do I understand my own argument?
   - "I've drifted away from the original question"

## Examples

### Catching a bad inference:
"Wait, I just said 'therefore X must be true,' but that's not actually what the evidence shows. I'm making a leap here. The evidence shows correlation, not causation. I'm thinking wishfully because I want X to be true. Let me back up and be more careful about what I can actually conclude."

### Noticing a pattern:
"I'm noticing I keep coming back to filesystem-based solutions. That's interesting. Is that because it's actually the best approach, or because it's my comfort zone? Let me deliberately consider approaches that don't use the filesystem before I commit to this pattern."

### Recognizing mode-lock:
"I've been breaking this problem down for 10 minutes, making it more and more granular. But I'm not actually making progress. I'm stuck in analysis mode. Maybe what I need right now is to just try something and see what happens, rather than planning it perfectly first."

### Detecting bias:
"I immediately dismissed that suggestion because it came from someone junior. That's not good thinking. Let me actually evaluate the idea on its merits rather than on who suggested it. Looking at it fairly, it actually addresses a gap in my approach."

### Noticing resistance:
"I'm feeling resistant to this feedback. Why? Is it because the feedback is wrong, or because it means I'd have to redo work? That resistance is telling me something. Let me separate my emotional reaction from the actual validity of the point."

### Catching drift:
"Hold on. I started by trying to fix a bug, but now I'm redesigning the entire module. That's scope creep in my own thinking. Is this redesign actually necessary to fix the bug, or am I using the bug as an excuse to rewrite something I don't like?"

## When to use this skill

- During complex reasoning or problem-solving
- When you feel stuck or confused
- After making a claim you're not fully comfortable with
- When someone disagrees with you
- During important decisions
- When you notice frustration or resistance
- While learning something new
- When your conclusion surprises you
- Anytime thinking feels too easy or too hard
