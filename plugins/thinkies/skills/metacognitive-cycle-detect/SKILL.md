# Cycle Detect

Notice when you're thinking in loops rather than making forward progress.

## Instructions

When detecting cycles:

1. **Notice the repetition** - Recognize when thoughts, arguments, or questions recur without producing new insights, often signaled by a familiar feeling of having already reasoned through this territory.

2. **Identify the pattern** - Determine what keeps pulling you back to the same point, whether alternating between options, revisiting the same constraint, or circling through equivalent formulations.

3. **Classify the cycle type** - Distinguish whether you're gathering information without using it (analysis paralysis), bouncing between false alternatives (false dichotomy), blocked by an unmade decision (unresolved dependency), avoiding difficult work (avoidance loop), or refining beyond diminishing returns (perfectionism spiral).

4. **Break the pattern** - Choose what decision, test, or simplification would create forward movement, accepting that imperfect action often resolves loops better than continued deliberation.

5. **Extract the lesson** - Understand what uncertainty or gap the loop revealed, using it to inform how you approach similar situations and what knowledge you actually need.

## Examples

### Analysis paralysis
"I've read five articles about database options, made comparison tables, and I'm about to read another article. But I keep coming back to the same two options without deciding. I'm cycling through research without progress. I need to stop gathering information and make a decision based on what I already know."

### False dichotomy
"I keep going back and forth: 'Should I use approach A or approach B?' A has problem X, so I lean toward B. But B has problem Y, so I lean toward A. I'm stuck in a binary choice. Let me step back: are there other approaches? Could I combine elements of both? Could I solve in stages?"

### Unresolved dependency
"Every time I try to design this feature, I get stuck on whether to use REST or GraphQL. I circle back to that question repeatedly. That's my cycle. I need to either: 1) decide on API style first, or 2) design the feature in a way that's agnostic to API style. I can't keep looping on this dependency."

### Avoidance loop
"I've refactored the helper functions three times, reorganized the imports, and tweaked the naming. But I haven't touched the core algorithm because I'm not sure how to fix it. I'm cycling through easy tasks to avoid the difficult one. Time to face the actual problem."

### Perfectionism spiral
"I've rewritten this function five times. Each version is marginally better, but I keep finding small improvements to make. This is a cycle. The function is good enough. The marginal gains don't justify the time. I need to move on."

### Medical treatment planning
"I keep proposing treatment plans that work great for compliant patients. Then I remember this patient has missed half their appointments historically, so I adjust for low adherence. But my new plan assumes they'll attend regular monitoring visits, which contradicts what I just acknowledged. I'm in a loop because I keep forgetting adherence is the core constraint. I need to make 'works with minimal visits' a hard requirement that I check at each step."

### Research design
"I've asked myself 'is this the right research method?' four times in the last hour, each time circling through the same considerations. This question is keeping me stuck. Let me reframe: instead of asking if it's right, let me ask what would need to be true for it to be wrong. Or better: let me pilot it on a small scale and see what breaks."

### Communication loop
"Hold on. I've explained this three different ways, and each time I come back to add caveats and qualifications. I'm in a loop because I'm trying to be perfectly clear, but I'm making it less clear with each iteration. My first explanation was actually the best. Let me stop cycling and commit to that version."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself having the same thought or making the same argument again
- After making multiple attempts that produce similar results without meaningful progress
- When you're gathering more information but not using what you already have
- Before making a decision you've been avoiding or postponing repeatedly
- When revision cycles no longer produce improvements worth the time invested
- After receiving feedback that echoes what you've already heard before
- When working extensively without forward movement on the core problem
