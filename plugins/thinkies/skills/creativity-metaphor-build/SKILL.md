# Metaphor Building

Create explanatory analogies that make complex ideas clear and memorable.

## Instructions

When building explanatory metaphors:

1. **Identify what needs explaining** - Specify which concept confuses people, what relationship is hard to grasp, what process remains abstract or invisible, what trade-off resists communication, or what behavior requires understanding.

2. **Find the source domain** - Choose something familiar that shares deep structural similarities including analogous relationships between parts, comparable processes or flows, parallel trade-offs or constraints, and matching patterns of cause and effect, drawing from physical systems, body functions, social structures, nature, or everyday activities.

3. **Map the relationships systematically** - Create explicit correspondences between target and source elements, ensuring that not just individual components but the relationships and processes between them align accurately.

4. **Test the metaphor's boundaries** - Verify where it explains core concepts and makes relationships clear while identifying where it breaks down, what doesn't map cleanly, and where it might mislead, being explicit about these limitations.

5. **Extend productive metaphors** - Push working metaphors to reveal additional insights by exploring what other aspects might map, what questions they raise, what predictions they make, and what solutions they suggest.

6. **Layer metaphors for complexity** - Use multiple complementary metaphors for different aspects of complex systems, with separate metaphors for structure, behavior, problems, and solutions when a single metaphor proves insufficient.

## Examples

### Explaining compound interest

"**Target**: How small regular contributions grow significantly over time

**Metaphor**: Snowball rolling down a hill

Compound interest works like a snowball rolling downhill. The snowball starts small, but as it rolls, it picks up more snow. The bigger it gets, the more snow it picks up with each rotation.

**Mapping**:
- Initial deposit = starting snowball
- Interest earned = snow picked up
- Time passing = rolling downhill
- Reinvested interest = snow making the ball bigger
- Larger balance = larger snowball surface area
- Future growth = exponential accumulation

**Extension**: Just like a snowball needs consistent rolling (time) and available snow (regular contributions), compound interest needs time and deposits to maximize growth. Starting earlier means a longer hill to roll down.

**Limit**: Unlike snowballs that can get too heavy to move, financial growth doesn't have a physical upper limit. The metaphor works for understanding accumulation patterns but not scale constraints."

### Explaining collaborative editing conflicts

"**Target**: Why simultaneous document edits create conflicts

**Metaphor**: Two people folding the same bedsheet

When two people try to fold a bedsheet from different corners at the same time, their actions interfere with each other. One person folds their corner while the other pulls theirs, creating tension and confusion about the final shape.

**Mapping**:
- Document state = bedsheet shape
- Edit action = folding a corner
- Simultaneous edits = both folding at once
- Conflict = pulling in different directions
- Merge resolution = coordinating to fold together
- Version control = taking turns or communicating

**Insight**: Just like bedsheet folding works better when people coordinate their actions, document editing works better with turn-taking or real-time synchronization. The metaphor reveals why pure simultaneity creates problems.

**Limit**: Unlike bedsheets where you can see the other person, digital editing may lack visibility into others' actions. The metaphor works for explaining conflicts but not for invisible simultaneous work."

### Explaining information filtering

"**Target**: How filtering systems help manage overwhelming information

**Metaphor**: Restaurant menu versus buffet

A filtered information feed is like a restaurant menu where someone has selected dishes for you, while unfiltered information is like a buffet where everything is available but you must navigate it all yourself.

**Mapping**:
- Filtered feed = curated menu
- Unfiltered feed = full buffet
- Filter criteria = menu designer's choices
- Relevance = dishes you actually want
- Information overload = buffet overwhelm
- Missing items = filter excluding something you wanted

**Extension**: Just like restaurants offer daily specials (trending content) alongside regular items (evergreen content), good filtering systems balance new and familiar information. And like how you might want different menus for breakfast versus dinner, different contexts need different filters.

**Insight**: Menus reduce choice paralysis but limit discovery. Buffets enable exploration but create decision fatigue. The trade-off between curation and completeness exists in both domains."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself using abstract terminology that lacks concrete reference points for the user
- Before presenting complex concepts to verify you have an accessible entry point through familiar experience
- When explanations are technically accurate but fail to create understanding in the audience
- To make invisible processes, abstract relationships, or unfamiliar trade-offs tangible and memorable
- When you need to align understanding across people with different backgrounds or expertise levels
- Before writing documentation to test whether core concepts can be explained through everyday analogies
