# Cognitive Load

Monitor and manage how much you're trying to think about at once.

## Instructions

When managing cognitive load:

1. **Notice overload symptoms**:
   - Am I losing track of details?
   - Are things getting confused in my mind?
   - Do I feel mentally cluttered?
   - "I'm trying to hold too many things in my head at once"

2. **Count what you're juggling**:
   - How many concepts am I tracking?
   - How many constraints am I considering?
   - How many threads am I following?
   - "I'm trying to think about A, B, C, D, and E simultaneously"

3. **Simplify strategically**:
   - What can I table for now?
   - What can I write down instead of remembering?
   - What can I decide later?
   - "Let me focus on just X and Y first, then come back to Z"

4. **Break down complexity**:
   - Can I separate this into stages?
   - Can I solve a simpler version first?
   - What's the core issue vs peripheral details?
   - "Let me ignore edge cases initially and handle the main path first"

5. **Use external memory**:
   - What should I write down?
   - What can I offload to tools?
   - What do I need to keep in mind vs look up?
   - "I'll write these requirements down so I can focus on design"

6. **Recognize when to pause**:
   - Am I too deep in the weeds?
   - Have I lost the forest for the trees?
   - Do I need to zoom out?
   - "This is getting too complicated, let me step back"

## Examples

### Recognizing overload:
"I'm trying to simultaneously think about the API design, database schema, error handling, caching strategy, and authentication flow. That's too much. I keep forgetting details and confusing which component does what. Let me focus on just the API design first, with placeholder assumptions about the rest."

### Strategic simplification:
"This problem has 15 different edge cases I'm trying to account for. My thinking is getting tangled. Let me solve it for the happy path first, verify that works, then add edge case handling one at a time. I can't hold all of this complexity at once effectively."

### Offloading to tools:
"I'm mentally tracking which files need which changes, what depends on what, what's breaking, and what's fixed. That's too much working memory. Let me write out a list of files and their status, so I can focus my mind on one change at a time rather than trying to remember everything."

### Chunking appropriately:
"This function is trying to: validate input, transform data, call three APIs, handle errors, cache results, and log events. I can't reason about all of that at once. Let me break it into functions that each do one thing, so I can think about them separately."

### Recognizing depth:
"I've gone four levels deep into this abstraction trying to understand how it works. I've lost context for why I'm even here. Let me come back up to the surface, remember what I'm actually trying to accomplish, and see if I even need to understand this deeply right now."

### Managing multiple constraints:
"I'm trying to optimize for speed, memory, readability, maintainability, and testability all at once. I can't hold all those goals in mind simultaneously. Let me prioritize: readability first, then I'll optimize if needed. That narrows what I need to think about."

### Productive simplification:
"The real system has authentication, rate limiting, retries, and circuit breakers. But to understand why this bug is happening, I don't need to think about all of that. Let me build a minimal reproduction that just focuses on the core behavior. Once I understand that, I can add complexity back."

## When to use this skill

- Feeling mentally overwhelmed or scattered
- Making mistakes from juggling too much
- Losing track of what you're doing
- Struggling to explain something clearly
- Getting confused by your own thinking
- Trying to consider too many factors at once
- When simplification feels dangerous but might be necessary
- Before starting a complex task
- When debugging something intricate
