# Random Input

Deliberately introduce unrelated elements to jolt your thinking out of familiar patterns.

## Instructions

Randomness disrupts your brain's tendency to follow well-worn paths. Here's how to use it effectively:

### 1. Choose your random source

**Physical objects**: Look around your space
- Pick the 3rd object to your left
- What's in your pocket or bag?
- Random item on your desk
- Something you can see through a window

**Words**: Use language randomly
- Open a book to a random page, point to a word
- Use a random word generator
- Pick a random Wikipedia article
- Choose a word from a magazine or sign

**Concepts**: Draw from different domains
- Random animal, plant, or natural phenomenon
- Historical event or person
- Movie, song, or artwork
- Place you've been or want to visit
- Childhood memory

**Actions or processes**: Think about verbs
- Cooking technique
- Sport or game move
- Dance step
- Building or repair process

Example: "I'm looking around... I see a coffee mug. Let's work with that."

### 2. Force connections to your problem

**Don't be selective**: Work with whatever randomness gives you. The point is the disconnect forces new thinking.

Ask connection questions:
- "How is my problem like [random input]?"
- "What qualities does [random input] have?"
- "What does [random input] do that I could apply here?"
- "If [random input] could solve this, how would it?"
- "What metaphor can I build between these?"

Example with coffee mug:
"My problem is slow page loads. A coffee mug...
- Holds something hot that cools down (what if we preloaded and kept things 'warm'?)
- Has a handle for easy holding (what if we made the slow part easier to grip/understand?)
- Comes in different sizes (what if users chose their load size?)
- Keeps contents contained (what if we isolated slow components?)"

### 3. Extract attributes and patterns

**Break down your random input into characteristics**:

For a physical object:
- Material: What's it made of?
- Function: What's its purpose?
- Shape: How is it structured?
- Usage: How do people interact with it?
- Origins: Where does it come from?

For a concept:
- Properties: What defines it?
- Behaviors: How does it act?
- Relationships: What does it connect to?
- Processes: How does it work or change?

Example with "ocean":
- Properties: vast, deep, salty, interconnected
- Behaviors: waves, tides, currents, erosion
- Relationships: ecosystem, water cycle, weather
- Processes: evaporation, circulation, life cycles

Now force each attribute onto your problem:
"Our API design is... vast like the ocean? What if we made it feel that comprehensive? Deep? What if we had layers of depth? Tidal? What if we had predictable usage patterns? Currents? What if we guided users along common paths?"

### 4. Use random constraints

**Pick a random number**: Apply it as a constraint
- Random number: 7
- "What if we could only have 7 API endpoints?"
- "What if response time had to be under 7ms?"
- "What if we supported exactly 7 use cases?"

**Random combination**: Mix random elements
- Two random words: "butterfly" + "concrete"
- "What if our solution was solid like concrete but transformative like a butterfly?"
- "What if we built something permanent that enabled change?"

### 5. Random role or perspective

**Pick a random person or character**:
- Historical figure
- Fictional character
- Professional from different field
- Animal or mythical creature

Ask: "How would [random persona] approach this problem?"

Example:
- "How would Marie Curie approach our data analysis problem?"
  - Rigorous experimentation, measuring precisely, isolating variables, not accepting conventional wisdom
- "How would a cat solve our UX issue?"
  - Ignore complexity, find the most comfortable path, demand simplicity, be unpredictably curious

### 6. Random prompt generators

Use these sentence starters with random elements:

- "What if [problem] was more like [random thing]?"
- "If [problem] were made of [random material], how would it change?"
- "Imagine [problem] in the context of [random place or time]"
- "If [random person] designed this, they would..."
- "The connection between [problem] and [random input] is..."

### 7. Embrace the absurd

**Don't filter**: The stranger the connection, the more it disrupts predictable thinking

If the random input seems completely unrelated, perfect. That's the point.

Work with it:
- "This seems ridiculous, but..."
- "On the surface these have nothing in common, but what if..."
- "This is forcing me to think about..."

## How to use random input effectively

**Set a quantity goal**: Generate at least 10 connections before evaluating any. Resist the urge to judge too early.

**Time box it**: Give yourself 5 minutes to work with one random input, then grab another if needed.

**Combine randoms**: Use 2-3 random inputs together for even more unusual combinations.

**Share the weird ones**: When working with a team, sharing absurd connections often makes others laugh, which relaxes thinking and generates more ideas.

**Look for the seed**: You're not looking for complete solutions in random connections, just seeds of ideas that you can develop further.

## Examples

### Feature design stuck:
"We need a better way for users to organize their projects.

**Random input**: Grocery store

**Forced connections**:
- Aisles: What if projects were auto-categorized into sections?
- Shopping cart: What if you collected items before 'checking out' a project?
- Weekly sales: What if we highlighted recently active projects?
- Checkout lanes: What if we had fast-track for simple projects?
- Store loyalty program: What if organization earned rewards?

**Useful seed**: The shopping cart metaphor is interesting. Users could 'shop' for features and components, adding them to a project cart before committing. Makes the process more exploratory and less commitment-heavy upfront."

### Technical problem:
"Database queries are slow and we're not sure why.

**Random input**: Traffic jam

**Forced connections**:
- Too many cars: Too many concurrent queries?
- Poor road design: Bad indexes, like inefficient road layouts?
- Rush hour: Predictable slow times suggest batching opportunity?
- Accidents blocking lanes: One bad query blocking others?
- Alternative routes: Could queries use different paths/indexes?

**Useful insight**: The 'accident' metaphor made me think about query blocking. We should check if long-running queries are locking tables and blocking others. Also, the rush hour angle suggests we look at query patterns by time of day."

### Communication challenge:
"Need to explain why refactoring is important to non-technical manager.

**Random input**: Dental hygiene

**Forced connections**:
- Brushing teeth: Regular maintenance prevents bigger problems
- Cavities: Small issues become expensive if ignored
- Professional cleaning: Sometimes you need expert care
- Preventive vs. reactive: Cheaper to maintain than to fix
- Invisible until it hurts: Problems aren't obvious until severe

**Perfect metaphor**: 'Refactoring is like dental hygiene for code. You can skip brushing and your teeth seem fine for a while, but eventually you're looking at root canals instead of cleanings. Regular refactoring prevents painful rewrites.' This landed immediately."

### Brainstorming new product:
"Need ideas for a new developer tool.

**Random input**: Garden

**Forced connections**:
- Seeds that grow: What if code templates evolved over time?
- Seasonal planting: What if tools suggested what to build based on timing?
- Companion planting: What if the tool showed which libraries work well together?
- Pruning: What if it identified unused code to remove?
- Composting: What if old code could be broken down and reused?

**Interesting direction**: The companion planting idea is compelling. A tool that analyzes library combinations and warns about conflicts, suggests better alternatives, or shows what works well together based on real usage data."

## When to use this skill

- Breaking through creative blocks
- Generating fresh ideas when stuck in obvious solutions
- Brainstorming sessions that feel stale
- Finding new metaphors for communication
- Challenging assumptions you didn't know you had
- Solo ideation when you need to think differently
- Adding variety to problem-solving approaches
- Making connections between disparate concepts
