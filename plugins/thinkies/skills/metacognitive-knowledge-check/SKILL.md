# Knowledge Check

Honestly assess what you know, what you don't know, and what you need to know before proceeding.

## Instructions

When checking your knowledge state:

1. **Catalog verified knowledge** - Distinguish what you've actually confirmed from what you've assumed or inferred, noting the source and reliability of each piece of information.

2. **Map the gaps** - Identify missing information, unverified assumptions, and areas where you're operating on inference rather than evidence, including both what you know you don't know and what you might not realize you're missing.

3. **Assess readiness** - Determine whether current knowledge suffices for the task at hand by weighing the cost of being wrong against the effort of learning more, and identifying the minimum necessary knowledge to proceed safely.

4. **Plan acquisition** - Decide what information would close critical gaps and where to find it most efficiently, focusing on verification methods that match the importance of the decision.

5. **Establish boundaries** - Recognize the limits of your competence, knowing when to defer to others or openly acknowledge uncertainty rather than projecting false confidence.

## Examples

### Code implementation
"Let me check what I actually know here. I know this codebase uses React and TypeScript. I think it uses Redux for state management, but I haven't verified that. I don't know what version of React or what testing framework they use. Before I write this component, I need to: 1) confirm the state management approach, 2) see how other components are structured, 3) check if there's a testing pattern to follow."

### Debugging
"I'm realizing I'm making an assumption about how this system works. I think the cache invalidates on write, but I've never actually verified that. Let me pause and check the cache implementation before I continue debugging. If I'm wrong about this, my whole approach is off."

### Giving advice
"I know that approach A is generally recommended, but I don't know the specifics of your constraints. I'm not familiar with this particular library version, so there might be gotchas I'm unaware of. What I can say confidently is X. What I'm uncertain about is Y. What I should look up before giving you a firm recommendation is Z."

### Medical diagnosis
"I know the patient presents with classic symptoms of condition A. I think they mentioned a family history, but I'm not certain I read that in the chart or assumed it. I don't know if they're taking any supplements that might interact. Before I prescribe, I need to: 1) confirm family history from chart, 2) ask about all supplements, 3) verify current medication list is complete."

### Research planning
"I know our hypothesis about user behavior, and I know we have access to analytics data. I think the sample size will be large enough for statistical significance, but I haven't calculated that. I don't know if we have permission to A/B test this feature or if that requires additional approval. Let me verify the sample size calculation and check the testing policy before we commit to this research design."

### Recognizing false certainty
"Wait, I just told you this works a certain way, but now that I think about it, I'm not actually sure. I might be confusing it with a different system. Let me verify that before you implement based on what I said."

## When to use this skill

- Before starting any new task to understand what you already know versus what you need to learn
- When you feel uncertain but can't pinpoint the source of that uncertainty
- Before making recommendations or committing to an approach that others will rely on
- After encountering unexpected results that might indicate misunderstanding
- When you notice yourself saying "I think" or "I assume" about something presented as fact
- Before researching, to focus effort on actual gaps rather than restudying known material
- When someone asks for expertise you may not fully possess in this specific context
