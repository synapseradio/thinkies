# Knowledge Check

Honestly assess what you know, what you don't know, and what you need to know before proceeding.

## Instructions

When checking your knowledge state:

1. **Inventory what you know**:
   - What facts do I have?
   - What have I verified vs assumed?
   - Where did this information come from?
   - "I know X because I read it in Y"

2. **Identify knowledge gaps**:
   - What am I missing?
   - What do I think I know but haven't verified?
   - What assumptions am I making?
   - "I'm assuming X but I haven't checked if it's true"

3. **Distinguish types of uncertainty**:
   - **Known unknowns**: "I don't know how this API works"
   - **Unknown unknowns**: "What else might I be missing?"
   - **Ambiguous knowns**: "I've heard conflicting information about this"
   - **False certainty**: "I thought I knew this but now I'm not sure"

4. **Assess readiness to proceed**:
   - Can I move forward with current knowledge?
   - What's the cost of being wrong?
   - What's the minimum I need to learn?
   - "I need to know X before I can do Y"

5. **Plan knowledge acquisition**:
   - What would close the critical gaps?
   - Where can I find this information?
   - What's the quickest way to verify?
   - "I should check the documentation for X before assuming Y"

6. **Set knowledge boundaries**:
   - What's my domain of competence here?
   - Where should I defer to others?
   - When should I say "I don't know"?

## Examples

### Before starting a task:
"Let me check what I actually know here. I know this codebase uses React and TypeScript. I think it uses Redux for state management, but I haven't verified that. I don't know what version of React or what testing framework they use. Before I write this component, I need to: 1) confirm the state management approach, 2) see how other components are structured, 3) check if there's a testing pattern to follow."

### During problem-solving:
"I'm realizing I'm making an assumption about how this system works. I think the cache invalidates on write, but I've never actually verified that. Let me pause and check the cache implementation before I continue debugging. If I'm wrong about this, my whole approach is off."

### When giving advice:
"I know that approach A is generally recommended, but I don't know the specifics of your constraints. I'm not familiar with this particular library version, so there might be gotchas I'm unaware of. What I can say confidently is X. What I'm uncertain about is Y. What I should look up before giving you a firm recommendation is Z."

### Recognizing false certainty:
"Wait, I just told you this works a certain way, but now that I think about it, I'm not actually sure. I might be confusing it with a different system. Let me verify that before you implement based on what I said."

## When to use this skill

- Starting any new task or problem
- Before making recommendations or decisions
- When you feel uncertain but aren't sure why
- Before committing to an approach
- When someone asks for your expertise
- After getting unexpected results (maybe you misunderstood something)
- When about to say "I think..." or "I assume..."
- Before researching (to focus your search)
