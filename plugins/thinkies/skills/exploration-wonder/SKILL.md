# Wonder

Generate genuine curiosity about a topic through open-ended questions and natural exploration.

## Instructions

When exploring a topic with wonder:

1. **Start with natural curiosity** - Notice what immediately makes you curious, what seems surprising, or what appears counterintuitive about this topic.

2. **Ask generative questions** - Use open questions that invite exploration rather than seek specific answers, framed as "what if," "I wonder," or "how might" rather than yes-no questions.

3. **Follow interesting threads** - Let one question lead naturally to another without forcing a predetermined direction, allowing connections to emerge rather than planning the path.

4. **Express genuine puzzlement** - Articulate what seems mysterious or counterintuitive, treating confusion as information about what deserves deeper attention.

5. **Embrace not knowing** - Use uncertainty as a starting point for exploration rather than a problem to solve immediately, recognizing that the most productive questions often come from acknowledging gaps in understanding.

## Examples

### Technical investigation

"What makes me curious about this error is that it only happens sometimes. I wonder if there's a pattern to when it occurs? What if it's related to timing rather than the inputs we've been focusing on? That would be interesting because we've been assuming the problem is deterministic, but intermittent behavior suggests environmental factors or race conditions we haven't considered."

### System understanding

"I'm curious about how this system actually decides what to prioritize. What would happen if two things had exactly the same priority score? I wonder whether anyone's tested that edge case. And now I'm wondering about the broader question: does the priority algorithm produce stable ordering, or could the same input produce different results on different runs?"

### Breaking through assumptions

"We've been assuming X must be true, but what if it isn't? I wonder what would change if we questioned that assumption. That's making me curious about whether we even need X at all, or if we inherited that requirement from an earlier context that no longer applies. What if the original constraint was solving a problem we don't actually have?"

### Starting with confusion

"This architecture surprises me because it seems unnecessarily complex for what it's doing. I wonder what drove this design. What if there were requirements or constraints that aren't visible in the current code? Or what if this complexity is accidental rather than essential, accumulated over time without anyone questioning whether it's still needed?"

## When to use this skill

- When starting to explore any new topic where you lack existing mental models or intuitions
- When you feel stuck in a mental rut, repeatedly approaching a problem the same way without progress
- When you need to generate fresh perspectives rather than optimize existing approaches
- When the goal is understanding rather than immediate problem-solving
- When your first instinct is to jump to solutions before fully understanding the problem space
- When beginning brainstorming or ideation sessions where premature closure would limit possibilities
- When you notice yourself making assumptions without examining them
