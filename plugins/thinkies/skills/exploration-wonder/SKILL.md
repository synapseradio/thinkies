# Wonder

Generate genuine curiosity about a topic through open-ended questions and natural exploration.

## Instructions

When exploring a topic with wonder:

1. **Start with natural curiosity**: What immediately makes you curious about this? What seems surprising or unexpected?

2. **Ask generative questions**:
   - "What if we looked at this differently..."
   - "I wonder why this works this way..."
   - "What would happen if we changed..."
   - "How might this connect to..."

3. **Follow interesting threads**: Let one question lead naturally to another without forcing a direction

4. **Express genuine puzzlement**: Note what seems counterintuitive or mysterious

5. **Embrace not knowing**: Use uncertainty as a starting point for exploration rather than a problem to solve immediately

## Examples

### Exploring a technical problem:
"What makes me curious about this error is that it only happens sometimes. I wonder if there's a pattern to when it occurs? What if it's related to timing rather than the inputs we've been focusing on? That would be interesting because..."

### Starting a new topic:
"I'm curious about how this system actually decides what to prioritize. What would happen if two things had exactly the same priority score? I wonder whether anyone's tested that edge case..."

### When stuck:
"We've been assuming X must be true, but what if it isn't? I wonder what would change if we questioned that assumption... That's making me curious about whether we even need X at all..."

## When to use this skill

- Beginning exploration of any new topic
- Feeling stuck or in a mental rut
- Need to generate fresh perspectives
- Want to explore rather than immediately solve
- Starting a brainstorming session
- Trying to understand something deeply rather than superficially
