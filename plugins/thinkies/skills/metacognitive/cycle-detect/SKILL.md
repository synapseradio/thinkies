# Cycle Detect

Notice when you're thinking in loops rather than making forward progress.

## Instructions

When detecting cycles:

1. **Notice repetition**:
   - Am I having the same thought again?
   - Have I made this argument before?
   - Am I asking the same question?
   - "I feel like I've been here before in this reasoning"

2. **Identify the loop pattern**:
   - What keeps bringing me back here?
   - What am I cycling between?
   - How long has this loop been running?
   - "I keep alternating between solution A and solution B without deciding"

3. **Recognize loop triggers**:
   - What assumption keeps resetting me?
   - What question am I not answering?
   - What am I avoiding deciding?
   - "Every time I think I've solved it, I remember constraint X and go back to square one"

4. **Distinguish cycle types**:
   - **Analysis paralysis**: Gathering more info without using it
   - **False dichotomy**: Bouncing between two options when more exist
   - **Unresolved dependency**: Can't proceed without deciding something
   - **Avoidance loop**: Circling around a hard question
   - **Perfectionism spiral**: Refining endlessly without finishing

5. **Break the cycle**:
   - What decision would let me move forward?
   - What assumption could I test instead of debating?
   - What's the simplest way to make progress?
   - "I need to just pick one and see what happens"

6. **Learn from the loop**:
   - Why did I get stuck here?
   - What was I uncertain about?
   - What would prevent this next time?
   - "This loop revealed I don't actually understand X"

## Examples

### Recognizing analysis paralysis:
"I've read five articles about database options, made comparison tables, and I'm about to read another article. But I keep coming back to the same two options without deciding. I'm cycling through research without progress. I need to stop gathering information and make a decision based on what I already know."

### False dichotomy loop:
"I keep going back and forth: 'Should I use approach A or approach B?' A has problem X, so I lean toward B. But B has problem Y, so I lean toward A. I'm stuck in a binary choice. Let me step back: are there other approaches? Could I combine elements of both? Could I solve in stages?"

### Unresolved dependency:
"Every time I try to design this feature, I get stuck on whether to use REST or GraphQL. I circle back to that question repeatedly. That's my cycle. I need to either: 1) decide on API style first, or 2) design the feature in a way that's agnostic to API style. I can't keep looping on this dependency."

### Avoidance loop:
"I've refactored the helper functions three times, reorganized the imports, and tweaked the naming. But I haven't touched the core algorithm because I'm not sure how to fix it. I'm cycling through easy tasks to avoid the hard one. Time to face the actual problem."

### Perfectionism spiral:
"I've rewritten this function five times. Each version is marginally better, but I keep finding small improvements to make. This is a cycle. The function is good enough. The marginal gains don't justify the time. I need to move on."

### Assumption loop:
"I keep designing solutions that run into the same problem: they assume synchronous processing. Then I remember our system is async, scrap the design, and start over. But the new design eventually assumes synchronous again. I'm in a loop because I keep forgetting this constraint. I need to make async-first a hard requirement that I check at each step."

### Question loop:
"I've asked myself 'is this the right abstraction?' four times in the last hour, each time circling through the same considerations. This question is keeping me stuck. Let me reframe: instead of asking if it's right, let me ask what would need to be true for it to be wrong. Or better: let me try it and see what breaks."

### Recognition and break:
"Hold on. I've explained this three different ways, and each time I come back to add caveats and qualifications. I'm in a loop because I'm trying to be perfectly clear, but I'm making it less clear with each iteration. My first explanation was actually the best. Let me stop cycling and commit to that version."

## When to use this skill

- Feeling stuck despite thinking hard
- Having a "haven't I thought about this already?" sensation
- Making multiple attempts that feel similar
- Revising without improving
- Unable to make a decision
- Gathering information without using it
- Refining endlessly
- Getting the same feedback repeatedly
- When others say "we've discussed this before"
- After working a long time without progress
