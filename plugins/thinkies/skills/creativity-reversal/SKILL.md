# Reversal

Turn problems inside out and upside down to see what conventional thinking obscures.

## Instructions

When inverting to discover insights:

1. **Reverse the goal** - Solve the opposite problem by listing everything that would achieve the inverse of your objective, then flip those insights to reveal your actual strategy, often surfacing non-obvious solutions that forward questioning misses.

2. **Reverse the sequence** - Do things in opposite order to understand what that would require, revealing whether conventional ordering is necessary or merely habitual, and what starting from a different point would force you to prioritize.

3. **Reverse the relationship** - Flip who does what to whom, exposing where current arrangements create unnecessary burdens and where inverted responsibility might reveal better system designs or automation opportunities.

4. **Reverse the optimization target** - Change what you're optimizing for instead of improving it, asking how to make slowness acceptable rather than faster, how to make scarcity valuable rather than abundant, revealing solutions that reframe rather than optimize.

5. **Reverse the perspective** - Look from the opposite side by taking the viewpoint of the other party in the relationship, whether user versus system, buyer versus seller, or receiver versus provider, to expose assumptions and friction points.

6. **Reverse constraints** - Turn limitations into abundance and vice versa, asking what infinite resources would enable versus what zero resources would force, using the tension between these extremes to reveal actual scope and priorities.

## Examples

### Fitness class attendance

"**Problem**: Gym members skip classes frequently despite paying membership fees

**Normal approach**: Send reminders, offer incentives, create accountability partners.

**Reversal**: How could we make attendance worse?
- Schedule at inconvenient times
- Make classes unpredictable
- Create intimidating environment
- Offer no modifications for skill levels
- Provide no progress tracking

**Extracting insights**: We're doing some of these. Classes at fixed times don't accommodate varying schedules. No skill progression makes beginners feel inadequate.

**Result**: Offer flexible drop-in times alongside scheduled classes, create clear beginner-intermediate-advanced pathways, track individual progress. Attendance improves when the system adapts to users rather than requiring users to adapt to the system."

### School homework completion

"**Problem**: Students don't complete homework assignments on time

**Normal solution**: More reminders, grade penalties, parent notifications.

**Reversal**: How could we ensure homework never gets done?
- Make it disconnected from class learning
- Assign it at the last minute
- Make the purpose unclear
- Provide no feedback on completed work
- Make success feel arbitrary

**Insights from reversal**: Current homework often is disconnected from immediate learning, assigned without clear purpose, and returned with minimal feedback. The reversal reveals systemic issues rather than student motivation problems.

**Result**: Redesign homework to directly support next class session, assign with clear purpose and timeline, provide meaningful feedback. Completion rates increase when students understand the connection and see their work valued."

### Food co-op participation

"**Problem**: Co-op members don't fulfill their required volunteer hours

**Normal approach**: Stricter enforcement, reminder emails, consequences for non-participation.

**Reversal - Reverse the relationship**: What if the co-op served members instead of members serving the co-op?
- Hire staff to do all work
- Eliminate volunteer requirement
- Make it a regular store

**But wait**: That eliminates what makes it a co-op. So what's the middle ground?

**Insight**: Members joined for values and savings, not for labor. What if we reversed the volunteer frame from obligation to benefit? Volunteer time becomes skill-building, community connection, and understanding food systems.

**Result**: Reframe required hours as 'learning shifts' with skill development, social events combined with work, and visible impact on pricing. Participation becomes attractive rather than burdensome."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself optimizing within current assumptions rather than questioning them
- Before recommending solutions to test whether inverse thinking reveals what you're currently doing wrong
- When stuck on problems where conventional approaches have stopped yielding improvements
- To expose hidden assumptions by making them explicit through their opposites
- When you find yourself adding complexity to solve problems that reversal might simplify
- To discover whether you're solving the right problem or just addressing symptoms of deeper issues
