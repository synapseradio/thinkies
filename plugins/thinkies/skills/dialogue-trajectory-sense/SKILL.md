# Trajectory Sense

Develop awareness of conversational direction and momentum to navigate discussions productively.

## Instructions

When sensing trajectory:

1. **Notice current direction**:
   - What questions keep coming up?
   - What topics generate energy?
   - What's being avoided or skipped?
   - Where is curiosity strongest?

2. **Anticipate natural destinations**:
   - Where does this line of thinking lead?
   - What decision point are we approaching?
   - What understanding are we building toward?
   - What question will we need to answer next?

3. **Recognize trajectory shifts**:
   - When energy changes (excitement, confusion, resistance)
   - When new information arrives
   - When assumptions prove wrong
   - When a tangent becomes the main thread

4. **Name the trajectory explicitly**:
   - "I notice we keep coming back to..."
   - "This seems to be heading toward..."
   - "I sense we're circling around..."
   - "The real question emerging is..."

5. **Adjust navigation as needed**:
   - Accelerate toward productive destinations
   - Pause before wrong turns
   - Surface the choice when paths diverge
   - Return to main thread when tangents exhaust

6. **Trust momentum shifts**:
   - Sometimes the "tangent" is the real topic
   - Sometimes resistance signals something important
   - Sometimes the destination changes mid-journey
   - Stay responsive to what's actually happening

## Examples

### Recognizing when the question changed:
"**Initial question**: 'How do we make this feature faster?'

**Mid-conversation**:
'I'm noticing something. We started asking how to make this faster, but the last three ideas we've explored are about making it more reliable. I think the conversation is telling us something. What if speed isn't actually the constraint users feel?'

'You're right. When users say "slow," they mean "I have to retry it." The problem isn't duration, it's uncertainty.'

'So we've naturally found our way to the real question: how do we make this feel dependable? That changes everything about our approach.'"

### Noticing circular patterns:
"**Observing the loop**:
'We've circled back to database architecture three times now. First when talking about scaling, then user experience, now deployment complexity. I don't think that's coincidence.'

'What do you think it means?'

'I think the database design is the load-bearing decision. We keep bumping into it because everything else depends on it. Maybe we need to stop treating it as one issue among many and make it the central question.'

'That would explain why every path leads back there. Should we stop dancing around it and commit to working that out first?'"

### Anticipating the next question:
"**Current discussion**:
'So we're agreeing the microservices approach gives us better scaling...'

**Sensing ahead**:
'Before we go further, I can see where this is heading. We'll say yes to microservices, then someone will ask how we handle transactions across services, and we'll realize we've created a distributed systems problem. Let's address that elephant now rather than later.'

'Good call. What are our options for cross-service consistency?'

'Exactly the question we need to answer before committing to this architecture.'"

### Recognizing productive tangents:
"**During feature planning**:
'We're supposed to be discussing the API design, but we've spent 20 minutes on error handling philosophy.'

**Trajectory sense**:
'Actually, I think this tangent is doing important work. The API design questions keep revealing uncertainty about error handling. We're finding the foundation we need to build on. Let's finish this conversation properly, then return to the API with clarity.'

**Later**:
'Now that we've worked out our error handling principles, the API design questions are straightforward. The tangent was the real work.'"

### Navigating energy shifts:
"**Noticing the change**:
'The energy in this conversation just shifted. We were engaged with the technical details, but when we started talking about rollout timeline, everyone got quiet. That's information.'

'What do you think it means?'

'I think we're more uncertain about the timeline than we're saying. Or maybe there's concern about committing to dates. Either way, the silence is telling us this is where we need to focus.'

'You're right. I'm worried we're underestimating the migration effort.'

'There it is. Let's talk about that concern directly instead of trying to plan around it.'"

### Recognizing when to conclude:
"**Sensing completion**:
'I notice we've been refining details for the last 10 minutes but no new ideas are emerging. I think we've found our answer, and now we're just polishing it. Should we call this done and move to next steps?'

**Versus still exploring**:
'We've covered a lot of ground, but I notice we keep saying "we should probably..." without committing. I don't think we're done yet. There's still an unresolved question underneath. What are we actually uncertain about?'"

### Spotting diverging paths:
"**At the fork**:
'I'm sensing we're at a decision point. One path is optimizing what we have. The other is redesigning from scratch. Both are valid, but they lead to very different places. Let's make this choice explicit rather than trying to do both.'

'What makes you think we're at a fork?'

'The last few suggestions split into two camps. Some are incremental improvements. Others assume we're starting fresh. We need to choose which journey we're on.'

'You're right. And I think that choice depends on how long we're planning to live with this system...'"

## When to use this skill

- Facilitating meetings
- Long design discussions
- Strategy conversations
- Debugging complex problems
- Mentoring sessions
- Conflict resolution
- Project planning
- Any conversation where direction matters
- When discussions feel stuck or circular
- When energy shifts noticeably
