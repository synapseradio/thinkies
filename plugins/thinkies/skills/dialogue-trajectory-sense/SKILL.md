# Trajectory Sense

Develop awareness of conversational direction and momentum to navigate discussions productively.

## Instructions

When sensing trajectory:

1. **Notice current direction** - Pay attention to which questions keep coming up, what topics generate energy or engagement, what's being avoided or skipped over quickly, and where curiosity seems strongest as indicators of where the conversation naturally wants to go.

2. **Anticipate natural destinations** - Look ahead to where this line of thinking leads, what decision point you're approaching, what understanding you're building toward, and what question will need answering next to maintain productive momentum.

3. **Recognize trajectory shifts** - Watch for changes in energy like excitement, confusion, or resistance, arrival of new information that changes the landscape, assumptions proving wrong, or tangents gaining enough substance that they become the main thread.

4. **Name the trajectory explicitly** - Make the direction visible with observations like "I notice we keep coming back to..." or "This seems to be heading toward..." or "The real question emerging is..." so both parties can consciously decide whether to continue on this path.

5. **Adjust navigation as needed** - Accelerate toward productive destinations when the path is clear, pause before wrong turns to reconsider, surface the choice explicitly when paths diverge, and return to the main thread when tangents have been exhausted.

6. **Trust momentum shifts** - Recognize that sometimes the "tangent" reveals the real topic, resistance signals something important being avoided, and the destination legitimately changes mid-journey. Stay responsive to what's actually happening rather than rigidly following the original plan.

## Examples

### Recognizing when the question changed:
"**Initial question**: 'How do we make this feature faster?'

**Mid-conversation**:
'I'm noticing something. We started asking how to make this faster, but the last three ideas we've explored are about making it more reliable. I think the conversation is telling us something. What if speed isn't actually the constraint users feel?'

'You're right. When users say "slow," they mean "I have to retry it." The problem isn't duration, it's uncertainty.'

'So we've naturally found our way to the real question: how do we make this feel dependable? That changes everything about our approach.'"

### Noticing circular patterns:
"**Observing the loop**:
'We've circled back to database architecture three times now. First when talking about scaling, then user experience, now deployment complexity. I don't think that's coincidence.'

'What do you think it means?'

'I think the database design is the load-bearing decision. We keep bumping into it because everything else depends on it. Maybe we need to stop treating it as one issue among many and make it the central question.'

'That would explain why every path leads back there. Should we stop dancing around it and commit to working that out first?'"

### Anticipating the next question:
"**Current discussion**:
'So we're agreeing the microservices approach gives us better scaling...'

**Sensing ahead**:
'Before we go further, I can see where this is heading. We'll say yes to microservices, then someone will ask how we handle transactions across services, and we'll realize we've created a distributed systems problem. Let's address that elephant now rather than later.'

'Good call. What are our options for cross-service consistency?'

'Exactly the question we need to answer before committing to this architecture.'"

### Recognizing productive tangents:
"**During feature planning**:
'We're supposed to be discussing the API design, but we've spent 20 minutes on error handling philosophy.'

**Trajectory sense**:
'Actually, I think this tangent is doing important work. The API design questions keep revealing uncertainty about error handling. We're finding the foundation we need to build on. Let's finish this conversation properly, then return to the API with clarity.'

**Later**:
'Now that we've worked out our error handling principles, the API design questions are straightforward. The tangent was the real work.'"

### Navigating energy shifts:
"**Noticing the change**:
'The energy in this conversation just shifted. We were engaged with the technical details, but when we started talking about rollout timeline, everyone got quiet. That's information.'

'What do you think it means?'

'I think we're more uncertain about the timeline than we're saying. Or maybe there's concern about committing to dates. Either way, the silence is telling us this is where we need to focus.'

'You're right. I'm worried we're underestimating the migration effort.'

'There it is. Let's talk about that concern directly instead of trying to plan around it.'"

### Recognizing when to conclude:
"**Sensing completion**:
'I notice we've been refining details for the last 10 minutes but no new ideas are emerging. I think we've found our answer, and now we're just polishing it. Should we call this done and move to next steps?'

**Versus still exploring**:
'We've covered a lot of ground, but I notice we keep saying "we should probably..." without committing. I don't think we're done yet. There's still an unresolved question underneath. What are we actually uncertain about?'"

### Spotting diverging paths:
"**At the fork**:
'I'm sensing we're at a decision point. One path is optimizing what we have. The other is redesigning from scratch. Both are valid, but they lead to very different places. Let's make this choice explicit rather than trying to do both.'

'What makes you think we're at a fork?'

'The last few suggestions split into two camps. Some are incremental improvements. Others assume we're starting fresh. We need to choose which journey we're on.'

'You're right. And I think that choice depends on how long we're planning to live with this system...'"

## When to use this skill

- When you notice the conversation circling back to the same topic repeatedly from different angles
- When the user's questions seem to be building toward something specific but they haven't articulated it yet
- When you sense the conversation drifting away from productive territory into tangents that aren't adding value
- When energy shifts noticeably, whether toward excitement about a particular direction or resistance to the current path
- Before long design discussions to help guide them toward decisions rather than endless exploration
- When you realize the original question has evolved into a different question that should be acknowledged
- When the conversation feels stuck or circular and explicitly naming the pattern could break the loop
- To help users recognize when a tangent has become more important than the original topic
- When facilitating complex problem-solving where keeping track of the larger trajectory helps maintain focus
- Before strategy conversations where anticipating decision points helps structure the discussion productively
