# Scenario Planning

Develop multiple plausible future scenarios to understand possibilities, test strategies, and prepare for uncertainty.

## Instructions

Build diverse scenarios to explore the possibility space:

1. **Identify key uncertainties**:
   - What major factors affect the situation?
   - Which factors are uncertain?
   - Which uncertainties matter most?
   - What could change dramatically?
   - Don't try to predict - identify what's unknowable
   - "We're uncertain about: [list critical uncertainties]"

2. **Select driving forces**:
   - Pick 2-3 most critical uncertainties
   - Choose factors that are:
     - Highly uncertain (not predictable)
     - High impact (would significantly change outcomes)
     - Independent (not correlated with each other)
   - "The key uncertainties are X and Y"

3. **Create scenario frameworks**:
   - Use extremes of your uncertainties as axes
   - If two uncertainties: create 2x2 matrix (4 scenarios)
   - If three uncertainties: create 2x2x2 space (8 scenarios)
   - Each quadrant/cell is a distinct future
   - "In this scenario, X is high and Y is low"

4. **Develop rich scenario narratives**:
   - Give each scenario a memorable name
   - Tell the story of how this future unfolds
   - What happened to get here?
   - What does this world look like?
   - Who wins and loses?
   - What are the key features?
   - Make it vivid and specific
   - "In the 'X' scenario, we see..."

5. **Test strategies against scenarios**:
   - How does our current plan perform in each scenario?
   - Which scenarios does it handle well?
   - Which scenarios does it fail in?
   - What strategies work across all scenarios (robust)?
   - What strategies work in only one scenario (risky bets)?
   - "Strategy A succeeds if [scenarios] but fails if [scenarios]"

6. **Identify signals and triggers**:
   - What early indicators tell us which scenario is emerging?
   - What events would confirm we're in scenario X?
   - What would we see 6 months before it's obvious?
   - Set up monitoring for these signals
   - "If we see [signal], we're likely moving toward [scenario]"

7. **Develop adaptive strategies**:
   - What can we do now that helps in multiple scenarios?
   - What options do we want to preserve?
   - What bets should we hedge?
   - What capabilities should we build?
   - How can we stay flexible?
   - "Regardless of which scenario unfolds, we should..."

## Examples

### Technology adoption for a company:

**Key uncertainties**:
- Will AI capabilities advance rapidly or plateau?
- Will regulations tighten significantly or stay light?

**Scenario framework** (2x2):

**Scenario 1: "AI Everywhere" (rapid advancement + light regulation)**
The story: AI capabilities explode. GPT-7 can do most knowledge work. Regulatory capture keeps rules minimal. Startups move fast and win. Every company becomes an AI company or dies. Competitive moat is data and speed of integration.

What this means: Our current manual processes become obsolete. Competitors automate everything. Employees need AI skills or become irrelevant. First movers capture markets.

**Scenario 2: "Controlled Innovation" (rapid advancement + tight regulation)**
The story: AI capabilities advance but are heavily regulated. Only compliant AI allowed. Certification required. Large companies navigate regulations better. Innovation slows but safety increases. Market leaders are those with regulatory expertise.

What this means: Compliance becomes competitive advantage. Small players can't afford regulatory overhead. Our legal team becomes critical. Slow, compliant deployment beats fast, risky deployment.

**Scenario 3: "Steady Progress" (slow advancement + light regulation)**
The story: AI improves incrementally. Hype fades. Practical applications emerge slowly. It's a tool, not a revolution. Companies that over-invested struggle. Balanced approach wins. Human expertise stays valuable.

What this means: Our current hybrid approach works fine. No need to panic or over-invest. Focus on proven applications. Keep human expertise in the loop.

**Scenario 4: "Innovation Blocked" (slow advancement + tight regulation)**
The story: AI plateaus AND gets regulated. Double whammy. Research slows. Compliance costs kill innovation. Market consolidates around incumbents. AI becomes like nuclear power - promise never realized due to restrictions.

What this means: Our investments in AI see poor returns. Focus shifts back to traditional competitive advantages. Human expertise is valuable again. Regulatory navigation matters more than technical capability.

**Strategy testing**:
- **Current plan** (invest heavily in AI capabilities): Works great in scenario 1, okay in scenario 2, wasteful in scenarios 3 and 4
- **Alternative** (build AI literacy but keep human expertise): Works okay in all scenarios, optimal in none
- **Hybrid** (invest in AI + compliance + maintain human skills): More expensive but robust across scenarios

**Signals to watch**:
- Scenario 1: Exponential improvement in benchmarks, minimal regulation passed
- Scenario 2: Major regulations proposed in multiple countries, rapid advancement continues
- Scenario 3: Plateau in capabilities, hype cycle trough
- Scenario 4: Plateau in capabilities, EU-style regulation spreading

**Adaptive strategy**: "Build AI literacy across the team (works in all scenarios). Keep human expertise strong (insurance against scenarios 3 and 4). Develop compliance processes (insurance against scenario 2). Start small AI projects now to learn (option value for scenarios 1 and 2). Don't bet the company on any single scenario."

### Product development roadmap:

**Key uncertainties**:
- Will our market expand or contract?
- Will customers want more features or simpler products?

**Scenario framework** (2x2):

**Scenario 1: "Feature Arms Race" (expanding market + more features)**
Story: Market grows rapidly. Competitors add features constantly. Customers compare feature lists. More is better. Sales happen at the feature-spec level. Product becomes a platform.

Reality: Need large team, rapid development, feature velocity is competitive advantage. Complexity is expected. Integration capabilities matter.

**Scenario 2: "Premium Simplicity" (expanding market + simpler products)**
Story: Market grows but users are overwhelmed. Backlash against feature bloat. Customers pay premium for products that "just work." Apple-style design wins. Simplicity is differentiator.

Reality: Need excellent design, ruthless prioritization, polish over features. Small focused team better than large team. Integration is table stakes, excellence is differentiator.

**Scenario 3: "Niche Sophistication" (contracting market + more features)**
Story: Market consolidates. Only power users remain. They want deep functionality. Shallow products die. Surviving products are complex but powerful. Prosumer market.

Reality: Serve remaining users extremely well. Deep features for experts. Okay to be complex - users are sophisticated. Platform capabilities critical.

**Scenario 4: "Essential Tools" (contracting market + simpler products)**
Story: Market commoditizes. Only core use cases survive. Customers cut budgets, keep only essential simple tools. Price pressure intense. Utility wins over sophistication.

Reality: Strip to core value prop. Compete on price and reliability. Simple, bulletproof, cheap. Large team is a liability.

**Strategy testing**:
- **Current plan** (add features based on requests): Works in scenarios 1 and 3, fails in scenarios 2 and 4
- **Focus on core**: Works in scenarios 2 and 4, loses in scenarios 1 and 3
- **Platform strategy**: Works in scenarios 1 and 3, over-engineered for scenarios 2 and 4

**Signals to watch**:
- Market expansion: New customer segments, growing budgets, new competitors entering
- Market contraction: Consolidation, budget cuts, competitors exiting
- Feature demand: Feature request volume, comparison shopping patterns, sales cycle focus
- Simplicity demand: Complaints about complexity, competitor simplicity messaging winning

**Adaptive strategy**: "Build a simple core that works perfectly (succeeds in scenarios 2 and 4). Make it extensible via plugins/integrations (succeeds in scenarios 1 and 3). This gives us options. Watch early signals: if market expands AND features matter (scenario 1), invest in platform. If market expands AND simplicity matters (scenario 2), invest in design and polish. Stay flexible for 6 months while signals clarify."

### Engineering team scaling:

**Key uncertainties**:
- Will funding continue or dry up?
- Will we be able to hire great engineers or struggle?

**Scenario framework** (2x2):

**Scenario 1: "Hypergrowth" (funding continues + easy hiring)**
Story: Series B closes. Market is hot. Great engineers available. Can scale quickly. Competition is about speed.

Reality: Hire fast, build fast. Process matters less than momentum. Some inefficiency okay. Speed to market is everything.

**Scenario 2: "Constrained Growth" (funding continues + hard hiring)**
Story: Money available but talent scarce. Competition for engineers intense. Can't hire fast enough. Every hire is precious.

Reality: Maximize output per engineer. Invest heavily in tooling and efficiency. Retain existing team at all costs. Build with small team.

**Scenario 3: "Resourceful Execution" (funding dries up + easy hiring)**
Story: Funding winter. Money tight but engineers available (layoffs elsewhere). Can hire but can't pay much.

Reality: Hire selectively at lower cost. Junior engineers available. Invest in training and mentorship. Efficiency critical. Do more with less.

**Scenario 4: "Survival Mode" (funding dries up + hard hiring)**
Story: No money, no talent available. Can't hire, can't pay. Must execute with current team or die.

Reality: Keep lights on with existing team. Cut everything non-essential. Focus on revenue. No growth, just sustainability.

**Strategy testing**:
- **Current plan** (hire 10 engineers this quarter): Only works in scenario 1
- **Build infrastructure for scale**: Makes sense in scenarios 1 and 2, wasteful in scenarios 3 and 4
- **Stay lean**: Safer in scenarios 3 and 4, might lose opportunity in scenarios 1 and 2

**Signals to watch**:
- Funding: Investor communications, market conditions, runway calculations
- Hiring: Offer acceptance rates, time to hire, quality of applicants

**Adaptive strategy**: "Plan for scenario 2 (constrained growth) as base case - invest in productivity and retention. If scenario 1 emerges (easy hiring), we can accelerate. If scenarios 3 or 4 emerge (funding issues), we've built efficiency and can cut hiring without cutting output. Build optionality: set up hiring pipeline but don't commit to offers until funding is certain."

### Open source project evolution:

**Key uncertainties**:
- Will corporate adoption increase or stay niche?
- Will community contributor base grow or shrink?

**Scenario framework** (2x2):

**Scenario 1: "Mainstream Success" (high corporate adoption + growing contributors)**
Story: Project becomes industry standard. Companies build on it. Contributors flood in. Governance challenges emerge. Competing interests.

Reality: Need strong governance. Foundation or corporate sponsorship. Deal with politics. Maintain quality despite volume. Sustainability focus.

**Scenario 2: "Corporate Tool" (high corporate adoption + shrinking contributors)**
Story: Companies use it but don't contribute back. Core team burns out. Becomes vendor-maintained. Community loses influence.

Reality: Either get paid by companies or burn out. Need sustainable model. Might need to restrict license or create paid tier. Community input declines.

**Scenario 3: "Hobbyist Paradise" (low corporate adoption + growing contributors)**
Story: Stays community project. Contributors passionate but not corporate-backed. Innovation happens but no stability guarantees. Fun but chaotic.

Reality: Keep it fun and experimental. No pressure for corporate features. Can make breaking changes. Focus on contributor experience over enterprise needs.

**Scenario 4: "Maintenance Mode" (low corporate adoption + shrinking contributors)**
Story: Project ossifies. Few users, fewer contributors. Stable but stagnant. Eventually archived.

Reality: Maintain what exists. Minimal new features. Focus on security patches. Eventual transition to maintenance-only or archive.

**Signals to watch**:
- Corporate adoption: Enterprise users, corporate sponsors, corporate contributor percentage
- Community health: Contributor growth, PR volume, issue engagement, conference presence

**Adaptive strategy**: "Build sustainable contribution model early (helps in all scenarios). If scenario 1 emerges, establish governance before crisis. If scenario 2, pursue sponsorship or dual licensing. If scenario 3, keep it fun and embrace chaos. If scenario 4, gracefully wind down rather than letting it rot."
