# Fallacy Detect

Spot common logical errors that undermine reasoning and arguments.

## Instructions

When detecting fallacies:

1. **Examine the argument structure** - Identify the claim being made, the supporting reasoning offered, and how the reasoning connects to the conclusion.

2. **Check for common fallacy patterns** - Look for false dichotomy (either/or when other options exist), slippery slope (claiming A inevitably leads to Z), ad hominem (attacking the person not the argument), straw man (misrepresenting a position to defeat it easily), appeal to authority (expert opinion without evidence), correlation assumed as causation, hasty generalization (broad conclusions from limited examples), circular reasoning (using the conclusion as a premise), appeal to emotion (using fear or sympathy instead of logic), or survivorship bias (only observing successes while ignoring failures).

3. **Identify the specific flaw and what's being hidden** - Determine where exactly the logic breaks down, what's being assumed incorrectly, and what relevant information is being ignored or obscured.

4. **Consider whether the reasoning might actually be valid** - Check if context makes what appears fallacious actually sound, whether domain-specific knowledge justifies the inference, or if there's valid reasoning that wasn't immediately apparent.

5. **Explain the problem and suggest corrections** - Show why the reasoning fails, provide counter-examples if helpful, and indicate how the argument could be strengthened with valid reasoning.

## Examples

### Product development

"**Argument**: 'Our competitor shipped this feature, so we need it too or we'll lose customers'

**Fallacy detected**: Hasty generalization + false dichotomy
- Assumes all customers value what competitor's customers value
- Presents binary choice: copy feature or lose market share
- Ignores different customer segments, use cases, strategic positioning
- Doesn't consider whether competitor's feature actually succeeded

**The flaw**: Markets aren't homogeneous. Competitor's feature choice reflects their strategy and customers, which may differ from yours. Valid response requires understanding whether your customers actually need this feature and whether it aligns with your product direction."

### Environmental regulation

"**Argument**: 'This factory produces jobs and economic growth. Shutting it down over pollution concerns would destroy the local economy'

**Fallacy detected**: False dichotomy + appeal to consequences
- Frames choice as operate-as-is or complete shutdown
- Ignores emissions controls, process improvements, phased compliance
- Uses economic harm to avoid addressing pollution evidence
- Assumes current operation mode is only economically viable option

**The flaw**: Regulatory compliance rarely requires binary all-or-nothing decisions. The economic argument, while containing real concerns, is used to bypass evaluation of whether pollution levels are acceptable and what mitigation options exist between extremes."

### Research interpretation

"**Argument**: 'The study was funded by the industry, so we should dismiss the findings'

**Fallacy detected**: Ad hominem (genetic fallacy)
- Attacks funding source rather than methodology or evidence
- Assumes funding automatically invalidates findings
- Ignores that methodology can be evaluated independently
- Doesn't consider whether findings replicate across independent studies

**The flaw**: Funding source warrants scrutiny for bias, but doesn't automatically invalidate results. Valid criticism requires examining the actual methodology, data, and whether findings align with independent research. Industry funding is a reason for careful evaluation, not automatic dismissal."

## When to use this skill

- When you notice yourself constructing an argument that feels persuasive but may rely on rhetorical shortcuts rather than sound logic
- Before presenting either/or choices to verify you haven't artificially narrowed options into a false dichotomy
- When you catch yourself using phrases like "everyone knows" or "obviously" that might mask hasty generalizations
- Before citing expert opinion or authority without examining the underlying evidence
- When noticing that your reasoning about causation is based primarily on correlation or temporal sequence
- To check whether you're attacking an idea's merit versus its source or proponent
- Before presenting an argument that relies on projected consequences to verify you're not engaging in slippery slope reasoning
- When reviewing your own analysis to ensure you haven't cherry-picked evidence that supports your preferred conclusion
