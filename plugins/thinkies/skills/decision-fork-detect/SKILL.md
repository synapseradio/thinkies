# Fork Detect

Identify moments where you're at a meaningful decision point, even when it doesn't feel like one.

## Instructions

When detecting decision forks:

1. **Notice the choice moment** - Pause when something feels like the natural next step and ask whether this is actually a choice point where you could proceed in different directions, checking if you're making an active decision or just following momentum and whether you can articulate why this path versus others.

2. **Assess what makes it a fork** - Determine whether different paths would lead to significantly different outcomes, whether the choice will be harder to reverse later, how it commits resources or shapes future options, and whether it's about what becomes possible rather than just what happens next.

3. **Map divergent paths and their consequences** - Identify the distinct directions available and how they differ, examine what each path enables or forecloses, consider what the default is if you don't choose actively, and look for hidden forks disguised as non-choices where "just" or "simply" often marks unexamined decisions.

4. **Make the fork visible and decide deliberately** - Name the decision explicitly rather than letting it happen implicitly, articulate the real question being answered (which is often deeper than the surface choice), and share with relevant stakeholders to enable genuine choice rather than drift.

## Examples

### Healthcare system redesign

"**Situation**: Medical clinic's scheduling system needs improvement, and we're about to upgrade to the cloud version of our current software.

**Fork detection**: This feels like a straightforward technology upgrade, but wait - is this actually shaping how the practice operates for years?

**What makes this a fork**: This is the first major process change since opening, it affects both staff workflow and patient experience daily, it sets a pattern for how we adopt technology going forward, and it will be difficult to change once staff are trained and patient data is migrated.

**Divergent paths**:

- **Upgrade current vendor's cloud system** (the default): Familiar interface requires minimal retraining, but perpetuates the same limitations we've complained about, enables continuity but forecloses workflow improvements.

- **Switch to integrated practice management platform**: Scheduling, billing, and records unified in one place with better patient data visibility, but requires major learning curve and six-month transition period.

- **Build custom scheduling on top of existing records system**: Perfect fit for unique workflow needs, but ongoing development cost and maintenance burden.

**The actual decision**: This isn't 'which scheduling system' - it's 'do we customize workflows to fit software, or customize software to fit workflows?'

**Making it visible**: Pause vendor renewal to shadow staff for one week understanding actual needs, involve both doctors and administrative staff in reviewing options, test finalists with real workflows, and document the decision rationale to guide future technology choices."

### School curriculum decision

"**Situation**: Parent group requests adding coding classes to elementary curriculum, and the initial response is to fit it into existing computer lab time.

**Fork detection**: This feels like adding a class, but does it actually reshape educational priorities and set precedent?

**What makes this a fork**: This is the first parent-driven curriculum request, it sets precedent for how community input influences academics, it competes with other subjects for limited instructional time, and it signals whether the school follows trends or maintains core focus.

**Divergent paths**:

- **Add coding to computer lab rotation**: Meets parent request and stays current, but forecloses time for digital literacy and research skills, leading to more requests for trendy topics and curriculum driven by parent preferences long-term.

- **Decline and focus on foundational skills**: Protects reading, math, and creative time but forecloses modern skill development and risks parent dissatisfaction and potential enrollment concerns.

- **Integrate computational thinking across subjects**: Develops logic skills without dedicated class time through cross-disciplinary approach, though with less depth in technical skills specifically.

**The actual decision**: This isn't 'should we teach coding' - it's 'how do we balance parent input with professional educational judgment?'

**Making it visible**: Present to school board rather than just principal decision, survey teaching staff on curriculum pressure and priorities, research age-appropriate skill development, define clear framework for evaluating future requests, and communicate the decision process transparently to parent community."

### Team structure decision

"**Situation**: Senior developer is leaving and we're about to post the same job description to hire a similar replacement.

**Fork detection**: This feels like replacement, but departures are actually reshaping moments for team structure.

**What makes this a fork**: Team dynamics will shift regardless of who we hire, we have a rare chance to rethink team composition, the budget exists but doesn't have to fund the same role, and what we do now shapes the team for years.

**Divergent paths**:

- **Hire senior developer replacement**: Maintains current structure and technical capability but needs three to four month search and forecloses using budget differently.

- **Hire two junior developers**: Changes team composition with more capacity but less experience, faster to hire but requires establishing mentorship model.

- **Promote from within and hire different role**: Shows internal career path and could add DevOps or design capability instead, fundamentally changing team capabilities.

- **Don't replace, redistribute work**: Use budget for tooling or contractors, test whether role was necessary, create smaller but better-equipped team.

**The actual decision**: Not 'who replaces this person' but 'what should our team look like going forward?'

**Making it visible**: Assess what the departing person actually did versus what the team actually needs, identify strategic direction and future needs rather than replicating past structure, and involve team in the discussion."

## When to use this skill

- When something feels like the obvious next step but you haven't examined alternatives
- Before committing resources to what seems like a routine decision
- When you notice yourself or others using words like "just" or "simply" to describe an action
- At the first instance of a new type of situation, since it sets precedent
- When you're about to proceed based on momentum rather than active choice
- Before presenting a single recommendation to the user without surfacing the actual decision being made
- When team or organizational changes are happening that feel administrative but may be structural
